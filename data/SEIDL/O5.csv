It also eliminates the need for a company to rely on one individual for security expertise should the employee become disgruntled and decide to harm the company. Recovering from a disgruntled employee’s attack is easier when multiple employees understand the company’s security posture. Collusion is an agreement between two or more parties to defraud a person of their rights or to obtain something that is prohibited by law.

What risk type should he identify this as?",,A. Internal , B. Legacy systems , C. IP theft  , D. Software compliance,D,"The most accurate risk descriptor for this is software compliance. Although this is an internal risk, software compliance fully describes the issue. Intellectual property (IP) theft risk occurs when an organization’s intellectual property is stolen, not when license violations for third parties occurs. This is not a legacy system, or at least it was not described that way in the question."
Objective-5,102,CH5_SEIDL,Gary is beginning his risk assessment for the organization and has not yet begun to implement controls. What risk does his organization face?,,A. Residual risk , B. IP theft risk , C. Multiparty risk  , D. Inherent risk,D,"Inherent risk is the risk that an organization faces before controls are put in place.  Without risk assessment and controls in place, Gary must first deal with the inherent risks the organization has as it exists today. Residual risk is the risk that is left after controls are put in place. The theft of intellectual property (IP) like algorithms, formulas, and processes are IP risks, and multiparty risk is risk that impacts more than one group, company, or person."
Objective-5,103,CH5_SEIDL,How is SLE calculated?,,A. AV * EF , B. RTO * AV , C. MTTR * EF  , D. AV * ARO,A,"The single loss expectancy (SLE) describes what a single risk event is likely to cost. It is calculated using the asset value (AV) times the exposure factor (EF), which is an estimated percentage of the cost that will occur in damage if the loss occurs. MTTR is the mean time to restore, ARO is the annual rate of occurrence, and RTO is the recovery time objective.  These are not part of the SLE equation."

Objective-5,116,CH5_SEIDL,Marcus wants to ensure that attackers can’t identify his customers if they were to gain a copy of his organization’s web application database. He wants to protect their Social Security numbers (SSNs) with an alternate value that he can reference elsewhere when he needs to look up a customer by their SSN. What technique should he use to accomplish this?,,A. Encryption , B. Tokenization , C. Data masking  , D. Data washing,B,"Tokenization is an ideal option for this scenario. Tokenization replaces a sensitive value with an alternate value that can be looked up in a table when the value needs to be referenced back to its original form. Encryption does not meet this need, data masking only hides part of the value, and data washing is not a commonly used term for techniques of this nature."

What type of risk management strategy has he employed?,,A. Acceptance , B. Avoidance , C. Transfer  , D. Mitigation,D,"Kirk has mitigated the risk to his organization by increasing the resources targeted by the DoS attack in an attempt to ensure that the attack will not be successful. Acceptance would involve simply letting the attacks occur knowing they are likely to stop, avoidance might involve finding a way to ensure the attacks cannot occur, and transfer could leverage a third-party mirror or anti-DoS hosting service."
Objective-5,122,CH5_SEIDL,The co-location facility that Joanna contracts to host her organization’s servers is in a flood plain in a hurricane zone. What type of risk best describes the risk that Joanna and other customers face?,,A. A multiparty risk , B. An internal risk , C. A legacy risk  , D. An IP theft risk,A,"A multiparty risk involves multiple organizations. Since there are multiple customers and organizations involved, this is an example of multiparty risk. An internal risk originates inside an organization—instead, this is an external risk. A legacy system risk is created by a system or process that is no longer supported or updated. An intellectual property (IP) theft risk occurs when proprietary information or trade secrets might be exposed or lost."
Objective-5,123,CH5_SEIDL,The cloud service that Natasha’s organization has used for the past five years will no longer be available. What phase of the vendor relationship should Natasha plan for with this service?,,A. Preparing a service MOU , B. An EOL transition process , C. Creating an NDA  , D.
