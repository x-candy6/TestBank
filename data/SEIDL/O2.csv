Objective-2,1,CH2_SEIDL,"Ben is reviewing configuration management documentation for his organization and finds the following diagram in his company’s document repository. What key information is missing from the diagram that a security professional would need to build firewall rules based on the diagram? Client workstations Firewall Ports 139, 445 Server Ports 139, 445 192.168.10/24 10.1.10.111",,A. The subnet mask , B. The service name , C. The protocol the traffic uses , D. The API key,C,"The diagram shows services and ports, but it does not list the protocol. Ben should ask if these are TCP- or UDP-based services, since an incorrect guess would result in a nonfunctional service, and opening up unnecessary protocols may inadvertently create exposures or risks. The subnet mask is shown where multiple systems in a network on the client side require it, the service name isn’t necessary for a firewall rule, and API keys should not be stored in documents like this."
Objective-2,2,CH2_SEIDL,You are responsible for network security at an e-commerce company. You want to ensure that you are using best practices for the e-commerce website your company hosts. What standard would be the best for you to review?,,A. OWASP  , B. NERC  , C. Trusted Foundry  , D. ISA/IEC,A,"The correct answer is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). It is the de facto standard for web application security.  The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is concerned with electrical power plant security, Trusted Foundry is a term used to describe a secure supply chain for computer ICs, and ISA/IEC standards are for securing industrial automation and control systems (IACSs)."
Objective-2,3,CH2_SEIDL,"Cheryl is responsible for cybersecurity at a mid-sized insurance company. She has decided to use a different vendor for network antimalware than she uses for host antimalware. Is this a recommended action, and why or why not?",,A. This is not recommended; you should use a single vendor for a particular security control. , B. This is recommended; this is described as vendor diversity. , C. This is not recommended; this is described as vendor forking. , D. It is neutral. This does not improve or detract from security.,B,"Vendor diversity gives two security benefits. The first is that there is no single point of failure should one vendor cease operations. The second benefit is that each vendor has a specific methodology and algorithms used for detecting malware. If you use the same vendor at all points where you need malware detection, any flaw or weakness in that vendor’s methodology will persist across the network. Using a single vendor means that any weakness in that vendor’s methodology or technology could impact the entire system or network.  Vendor forking is not a term in the industry, and this is not a neutral act; vendor diversity improves security."
Objective-2,4,CH2_SEIDL,"Scott wants to back up the contents of a network-attached storage (NAS) device used in a critical department in his company. He is concerned about how long it would take to restore the device if a significant failure happened, and he is less concerned about the ability to recover in the event of a natural disaster. Given these requirements, what type of backup should he use for the NAS?",,A. A tape-based backup with daily full backups , B. A second NAS device with a full copy of the primary NAS , C. A tape-based backup with nightly incremental backups , D. A cloud-based backup service that uses high durability near-line storage,B,"In this scenario, the best fit to Scott’s needs is a second network attached storage (NAS) device with a full copy of the primary NAS. In a failure scenario, the secondary NAS can simply take the place of the primary NAS while individual disks or even the whole NAS is replaced. Tape-based backups take longer to restore, regardless of whether they are full or incremental backups, although incremental backups can take more time in some cases since swapping tapes in order can add time to the restoration process. Finally, a cloud-based backup system would be useful if Scott was worried about a local disaster but would be slower than a local identical NAS, thus not meeting Scott’s primary requirement."
Objective-2,5,CH2_SEIDL,"Yasmine is responding to a full datacenter outage, and after referencing the documentation for the systems in the datacenter she brings the network back up, then focuses on the storage area network (SAN), followed by the database servers. Why does her organization list systems for her to bring back online in a particular series?",,A. The power supply for the building cannot handle all the devices starting at once.  , B. The organization wants to ensure that a second outage does not occur due to failed systems.  , C. The organization wants to ensure that systems are secure and have the resources they need by following a restoration order.  ," D. The fire suppression system may activate due to the sudden change in heat, causing significant damage to the systems. ",C,"Restoration order can be very important in a complex environment due to system dependencies. Restoration order can also ensure that the proper security controls are in place before systems are online. A datacenter should be able to handle systems coming online without failing if its power systems are properly designed. A second outage due to failed systems would mean that Yasmine has not determined why the outage has occurred, making restoration potentially dangerous or problematic. Finally, fire suppression systems should only activate for an actual fire or when fire precursors like smoke are detected, not for increased heat load."
Objective-2,6,CH2_SEIDL,Enrique is concerned about backup data being infected by malware. The company backs up key servers to digital storage on a backup server. Which of the following would be most effective in preventing the backup data being infected by malware?,,A. Place the backup server on a separate VLAN.  , B. Air-gap the backup server.  , C. Place the backup server on a different network segment.  , D. Use a honeynet.,B,"Air gapping refers to the server not being on a network. This means literally that there is “air” between the server and the network. This prevents malware from infecting the backup server. A separate VLAN or physical network segment can enhance security but is not as effective as air gapping. A honeynet is used to detect attacks against a network, but it doesn’t provide effective defense against malware in this scenario."
Objective-2,7,CH2_SEIDL,What type of attribute is a Windows picture password?,,A. Somewhere you are , B. Something you exhibit , C. Something you can do , D. Someone you know,C,"Windows picture passwords require you to click on specific locations on a picture. This is an example of a something-you-can-do factor. Geolocation or a network location are examples of somewhere you are, whereas something you exhibit is often a personality trait, and someone you know is exactly what it sounds like: someone who can identify you as an individual."
Objective-2,8,CH2_SEIDL,Which of the following is not a critical characteristic of a hash function?,,A. It converts variable-length input into a fixed-length output. , B. Multiple inputs should not hash to the same output. , C. It must be reversible. , D.It should be fast to compute.,C,"Hash functions convert variable-length inputs into fixed-length outputs while minimizing the changes of multiple inputs, resulting in the same output (collisions). They also need to be fast to compute. Hashes should not be reversible; they are a one-way function!"
Objective-2,9,CH2_SEIDL,Naomi wants to hire a third-party secure data destruction company. What process is most frequently used to ensure that third parties properly perform data destruction?,,A. Manual on-site inspection by federal inspectors , B. Contractual requirements and a csertification process , C. Requiring pictures of every destroyed document or device , D. All of the above,B,"The most common way to ensure that third-party secure destruction companies perform their tasks properly is to sign a contract with appropriate language and make sure that they certify the destruction of the materials they are asked to destroy. Manual on-site inspection by third parties is sometimes done as part of certification, but federal certification is not a common process. Requiring pictures of every destroyed document would create a new copy, thus making it a flawed process.  "
Objective-2,10,CH2_SEIDL,Olivia wants to ensure that the code executed as part of her application is secure from tampering and that the application itself cannot be tampered with. Which of the following solutions should she use and why?,,"A. Server-side execution and validation, because it prevents data and application tampering ", B. Client-side validation and server-side execution to ensure client data access , C. Server-side validation and client-side execution to prevent data tampering ," D. Client-side execution and validation, because it prevents data and application tampering",A,"Using both server-side execution and validation requires more resources but prevents client-side tampering with the application and data. For Olivia’s described needs, server-side execution and validation is the best option."
Objective-2,11,CH2_SEIDL,Trevor wants to use an inexpensive device to build a custom embedded system that can monitor a process. Which of the following options is best suited for this if he wants to minimize expense and maximize simplicity while avoiding the potential for system or device compromise?,,A. A Raspberry Pi , B. A custom FPGA , C. A repurposed desktop PC , D. An Arduino,D,"An Arduino is a microcontroller well suited for custom development of embedded systems. They are small, inexpensive, and commonly available. Unlike a Raspberry Pi, they are not a small computer, reducing their overall risk of compromise. A custom field-programmable gate array (FPGA) will typically be more complex and expensive than an Arduino, whereas a repurposed desktop PC introduces all the potential issues that a PC can include such as a vulnerable operating system or software."
Objective-2,12,CH2_SEIDL,Amanda wants to use a digital signature on an email she is sending to Maria. Which key should she use to sign the email?,,A. Maria’s public key , B. Amanda’s public key , C. Maria’s private key , D. Amanda’s private key,D,"Digital signatures are created using the signer’s private key, allowing it to be validated using their public key."
Objective-2,13,CH2_SEIDL,"Nick wants to make an encryption key harder to crack, and he increases the key length by one bit from a 128-bit encryption key to a 129-bit encryption key as an example to explain the concept. How much more work would an attacker have to do to crack the key using brute force if no other attacks or techniques could be applied?",,A. One more  , B. 129 more  , C. Twice as much  , D. Four times as much,C,"Adding one bit to a key doubles the work required. The original effort would have 2128 potential solutions, whereas the increased key length would require 2129. In real life, key lengths aren’t increased by 1; instead, they are typically increased by factors of 2, such as 128 to 265, or 1024 to 2048."
Objective-2,14,CH2_SEIDL,"Gurvinder knows that the OpenSSL passwd file protects passwords by using 1,000 rounds of MD5 hashing to help protect password information. What is this technique called?",,A.Spinning the hash , B.Key rotation , C.Key stretching , D.Hash iteration,C,"Key stretching is used to improve weak keys. One way of implementing it is by repeatedly using a hash function or a block cipher, increasing the effort that an attacker would need to exert to attack the resulting hashed or encrypted data. The rest of the options were made up."
Objective-2,15,CH2_SEIDL,Fred wants to make it harder for an attacker to use rainbow tables to attack the hashed password values he stores. What should he add to every password before it is hashed to make it impossible for the attacker to simply use a list of common hashed passwords to reveal the passwords Fred has stored if they gain access to them?,,A. A salt , B. A cipher , C. A spice , D. A trapdoor,A,"A salt is a value added to a string before it is hashed. The salt is stored so that it can be added to passwords when they are used in the future to compare to the hash. Since each salt is unique, this means that an attacker would need to generate a unique rainbow table for every salt to be able to attack the stored hashes effectively. For high-value passwords, this may be worthwhile, but for bulk lists of passwords, it is not a reasonable attack method."
Objective-2,16,CH2_SEIDL,Ian wants to send an encrypted message to Michelle using public key cryptography. What key does he need to encrypt the message?,,A. His public key  , B. His private key  , C. Her public key , D. Her private key,C,"Ian will use Michelle’s public key to encrypt the message so that only she can read it using her private key. If he wanted to sign the message, he could use his private key, and Michelle could use his public key to validate his signature. Neither Ian nor Michelle should ever reveal their private keys."
Objective-2,17,CH2_SEIDL,What key advantage does an elliptical curve cryptosystem have over an RSA-based cryptosystem?,,A. It can use a smaller key length for the same resistance to being broken. , B. It requires only a single key to encrypt and decrypt. , C. It can run on older processors. , D. It can be used for digital signatures as well as encryption.,A,"Elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) is faster because it can use a smaller key length to achieve levels of security similar to a longer RSA key (a 228-bit elliptical curve key is roughly equivalent to a 2,380-bit RSA key). Using the same key to encrypt and decrypt would be true for a symmetric encryption cryptosystem; however, neither of these are symmetric. Either algorithm can run on older processors given the right cryptographic libraries or programming, although both will be slower. Both can be used for digital signatures."
Objective-2,18,CH2_SEIDL,"What cryptographic capability ensures that even if the server’s private key is compromised,the session keys will not be compromised?",,A. Perfect forward secrecy , B. Symmetric encryption , C. Quantum key rotation , D. Diffie-Hellman key modulation,A,"Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is used to change keys used to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring that even if a compromise occurs, only a very small amount of data will be exposed.  Symmetric encryption uses a single key. Quantum key rotation and Diffie-Hellman key modulation are both terms made up for this question."
Objective-2,19,CH2_SEIDL,Alaina is reviewing practices for her reception desk and wants to ensure that the receptiondesk’s visitor log is accurate. What process should she add to the guard’s check-in procedure?,,A. Check the visitor’s ID against their log book entry. , B. Perform a biometric scan to validate visitor identities. , C. Require two-person integrity control. , D. Replace the guard with a security robot.,A,"Checking a visitor’s ID against their log book entry can ensure that the information they have recorded is correct and that the person’s ID matches who they claim to be. Biometric scans only work on enrolled individuals, meaning that many guests may not have biometric data enrolled. Two-person integrity control would only be useful if there was a concern that a guard was allowing unauthorized individuals into the facility. A security robot typically cannot validate a visitor’s identity from an ID and log entry. This may change as they become more advanced!"
Objective-2,20,CH2_SEIDL,"In an attempt to observe hacker techniques, a security administrator configures a nonproduction network to be used as a target so that he can covertly monitor network attacks. What isthis type of network called?",,A. Active detection , B. False subnet , C. IDS , D. Honeynet,D,Honeypots are designed to attract a hacker by appearing to be security holes that are ripe and ready for exploitation. A honeynet is a network honeypot. This security technique is used to observe hackers in action while not exposing vital network resources. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to detect activity that could indicate an intrusion or attack. Neither active detection nor false subnet is a common industry term.
Objective-2,21,CH2_SEIDL,What type of system is used to control and monitor power plant power generation systems?,,A. IPG , B. SEED , C. SCADA , D. ICD,C,"SCADA, or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems, are commonly used to manage facilities like power plants. The rest of the options were made up."
Objective-2,22,CH2_SEIDL,What major technical component of modern cryptographic systems is likely to be susceptibleto quantum attacks?,,A. Key generation , B. Elliptical plot algorithms , C. Cubic root curve cryptography , D. Prime factorization algorithms,D,"Prime factorization algorithms and elliptic curve cryptography are believed to be vulnerable to future quantum computing–driven attacks against cryptographic systems. Although this is largely theoretical at the moment, quantum encryption may be the only reasonable response to quantum attacks against current cryptographic algorithms and systems."
Objective-2,23,CH2_SEIDL,Geoff wants to establish a contract with a company to have datacenter space that is equipped and ready to go so that he can bring his data to the location in the event of a disaster. Whattype of disaster recovery site is he looking for?,,A. A hot site , B. A cold site , C. A warm site , D. An RTO site,C,"Geoff is looking for a warm site, which has some or all of the infrastructure and systems he needs but does not have data. If a disaster occurs, Geoff can bring any equipment that he needs or wants to the site along with his organization’s data to resume operations. A hot site is a fully functional environment with all the hardware, software, and data needed to operate an organization. They are expensive to maintain and run but are used by organizations that cannot take the risk of downtime. A cold site is a location that can be brought online but does not have systems; cold sites typically have access to power and bandwidth but need to be fully equipped to operate after a disaster since they are just rented space. An RTO is a recovery time objective, and it measures how long it should take to resume operations; it is not a type of disaster recovery site."
Objective-2,24,CH2_SEIDL,Olivia needs to ensure an IoT device does not have its operating system modified by third parties after it is sold. What solution should she implement to ensure that this doesnot occur?,,A. Set a default password. , B. Require signed and encrypted firmware. , C. Check the MD5sum for new firmware versions. , D. Patch regularly.,B,"If Olivia wants to ensure that third parties will be unable to modify the operating system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, requiring signed and encrypted firmware for operating system updates is an effective means of stopping all but the most advanced threats. Setting a default password means that a common password will be known. Checking the MD5sum for new firmware versions will help administrators validate that the firmware is legitimate, but signed and encrypted firmware is a much stronger control. Finally, regular patching may help secure the devices but won’t prevent OS modifications."
Objective-2,25,CH2_SEIDL,What statement is expected to be true for a post-quantum cryptography world?,,A. Encryption speed will be measured in qubits. , B. Nonquantum cryptosystems will no longer be secure. , C. Quantum encryption will no longer be relevant. ," D. Key lengths longer than 4,096 bits using RSA will be required.",B,"After quantum encryption and decryption technologies become mainstream, it is generally believed that nonquantum cryptosystems will be defeated with relative ease, meaning that quantum cryptography will be required to be secure. Qubits are quantum bits, not a measure of speed; quantum encryption will be the relevant solution in a post-quantum encryption world; and even very long RSA keys are expected to be vulnerable."
Objective-2,26,CH2_SEIDL,What function does counter mode perform in a cryptographic system?,,A. It reverses the encryption process. , B. It turns a block cipher into a stream cipher. , C. It turns a stream cipher into a block cipher. , D. It allows public keys to unlock private keys.,B,"Counter mode (CTR) makes a block cipher into a stream cipher by generating a keystream block using a nonrepeating sequence to fill in the blocks. This allows data to be streamed instead of waiting for blocks to be ready to send. It does not perform the reverse, turning a stream cipher into a block cipher, nor does it reverse the encryption process (decryption). Public keys cannot unlock private keys; they are both part of an asymmetric encryption process."
Objective-2,27,CH2_SEIDL,Which of the following items is not included in a blockchain’s public ledger?,,A. A record of all genuine transactions between network participants  , B. A record of cryptocurrency balances (or other data) stored in the blockchain  , C. The identity of the blockchain participants  , D. A token that identifies the authority under which the transaction was made ,D,"Blockchain public ledgers contain an identity for participants (although the identity may be semi-anonymous), the transaction record, and the balance or other data that the blockchain is used to store. Since there is no central authority, there is no token to identify authorities."
Objective-2,28,CH2_SEIDL,Suzan is responsible for application development in her company. She wants to have all web applications tested before they are deployed live. She wants to use a test system that is identical to the live server. What is this called?,,A. A production server  , B. A development server  , C. A test server  , D. A predeployment server ,C,"A test server should be identical to the production server. This can be used for functional testing as well as security testing, before deploying the application. The production server is the live server. A development server would be one the programmers use during development of a web application, and predeployment server is not a term typically used in the industry."
Objective-2,29,CH2_SEIDL,Alexandra is preparing to run automated security tests against the code that developers in her organization have completed. Which environment is she most likely to run them in if the next step is to deploy the code to production?,,A. Development  , B. Test  , C. Staging  , D. Production ,C,"Staging environments, sometimes called preproduction environments, are typically used for final quality assurance (QA) and validation before code enters the production environment as part of a deployment pipeline. Staging environments closely mirror production, allowing realistic testing and validation to be done. Development and test environments are used to create the code and for testing while it is being developed."
Objective-2,30,CH2_SEIDL,Chris wants to limit who can use an API that his company provides and be able to log usage of the API uniquely to each organization that they provide access to. What solution is most often used to do this?,,A. Firewalls with rules for each company’s public IP address  , B. User credentials for each company  , C. API keys  , D. API passwords ,C,"Application programming interface (API) keys are frequently used to meet this need.  An API key can be issued to an individual or organization, and then use of the API can be tracked to each API key. If the API key is compromised or abused, it can be revoked and a new API key can be issued. Firewall rules written to use public IP addresses can be fragile, since IP addresses may change or organizations may have a broad range of addresses that may be in use, making it hard to validate which systems or users are using the API. Credentials, including passwords, are not as frequently used as API keys."
Objective-2,31,CH2_SEIDL,Derek has been assigned to assess the security of smart meters. Which of the following is not a common concern for an embedded system like a smart meter?,,A. Eavesdropping  , B. Denial of service  , C. Remote disconnection  , D. SQL injection ,D,"Embedded systems like smart meters typically do not include a SQL server to attack, making SQL injection an unlikely issue. Derek should focus on securing the traffic from his meter, ensuring that denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are difficult to accomplish and that remotely disconnecting the meter using exposed administrative interfaces or other methods is prevented."
Objective-2,32,CH2_SEIDL,Selah wants to analyze real-world attack patterns against systems similar to what she already has deployed in her organization. She would like to see local commands on a compromised system and have access to any tools or other materials the attackers would normally deploy.  What type of technology could she use to do this?,,A. A honeypot  , B. An IPS  , C. An IDS  , D. A WAF ,A,"Honeypots are systems configured to appear to be vulnerable. Once an attacker accesses them, they capture data and tools while causing the attacker to think that they are successfully gaining control of the system. This allows defenders like Selah to study and analyze their techniques and tools without endangering their production systems. An intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion protection system (IPS) can detect and stop attacks, and may even capture some tools, but they are not designed to capture local commands and downloaded tools. A WAF is a web application firewall and is intended to stop attacks on web applications."
Objective-2,33,CH2_SEIDL,Charles sets up a network with intentional vulnerabilities and then instruments it so that he can watch attackers and capture details of their attacks and techniques. What has Charles set up?,,A. A black hole  , B. A honeyhole  , C. A spynet  , D. A honeynet ,D,"Honeynets are intentionally vulnerable networks set up to allow for capture and analysis of attacker techniques and tools. A black hole is a term commonly used for a system or network device where traffic is discarded, and black hole routing involves sending traffic to a null route that goes nowhere."
Objective-2,34,CH2_SEIDL,"Maria is a security engineer with a manufacturing company. During a recent investigation, she discovered that an engineer’s compromised workstation was being used to connect to SCADA systems while the engineer was not logged in. The engineer is responsible for administering the SCADA systems and cannot be blocked from connecting to them. What should Maria do to mitigate this threat?   ",,A. Install host-based antivirus software on the engineer’s system.  , B. Implement account usage auditing on the SCADA system.  , C. Implement an NIPS on the SCADA system.  , D. Use FDE on the engineer’s system. ,B,"Maria should implement ongoing auditing of the account usage on the SCADA system.  This will provide a warning that someone’s account is being used when they are not actually using it. Host-based antivirus is almost never a bad idea, but this scenario did not indicate that the compromise was due to malware, so antimalware may not address the threat. Since the engineer has access to the SCADA system, a network intrusion prevention system (NIPS) is unlikely to block them from accessing the system, and full-disk encryption (FDE) will not mitigate this threat because the system is live and running, meaning that the disk will be decrypted in use."
Objective-2,35,CH2_SEIDL,AES and DES are an example of what type of cipher? ,,A. Stream ciphers that encrypt groups of plain-text symbols all together  , B. Block ciphers that encrypt groups of plain-text symbols all together  , C. Stream ciphers that encrypt one plain-text symbol at a time  , D. Block ciphers that encrypt one plain-text symbol at a time ,B,"Both Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES) are block ciphers. That means that they encrypt groups (blocks) of plain-text symbols together as a single block. If you know that either AES or DES is a block cipher, you can eliminate half of the options here. If you know that a block cipher works on groups of symbols or blocks of text, you can also eliminate half the options as incorrect."
Objective-2,36,CH2_SEIDL,Gerard is responsible for secure communications with his company’s e-commerce server. All communications with the server use TLS. What is the most secure option for Gerard to store the private key on the e-commerce server?    ,,A. HSM  , B. FDE  , C. SED  , D. SDN ,A,"A hardware security module (HSM) is the most secure way to store private keys for the e-commerce server. An HSM is a physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys.  Full-disk encryption (FDE) will protect the data on the e-commerce server, but it won’t help store the key. It is also difficult to fully encrypt the e-commerce server drive, since the drive will need to be in use for the e-commerce to function. A self-encrypting drive (SED) is merely automatic full-disk encryption. Software-defined networking (SDN) won’t address the issues in this scenario, since it configures networks via software and does not provide secure key storage."
Objective-2,37,CH2_SEIDL,What purpose does a transit gateway serve in cloud services? ,,A. It connects systems inside of a cloud datacenter.  , B. It connects virtual private clouds and on-premises networks.  , C. It provides an API gateway between trust zones.  , D. It allows multicloud infrastructure designs. ,B,"Transit gateways are a transit hub used to connect VPCs (virtual private clouds) to onpremises networks. You can read more about transit gateways at docs.aws.amazon.com/ vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.html. IBM uses the same term, but for a very specific internal cloud connection."
Objective-2,38,CH2_SEIDL,"Web developers in your company currently have direct access to the production server and can deploy code directly to it. This can lead to unsecure code, or simply code flaws being deployed to the live system. What would be the best change you could make to mitigate this risk? ",,A. Implement sandboxing.  , B. Implement virtualized servers.  , C. Implement a staging server.  , D. Implement deployment policies. ,C,"You should implement a staging server so that code can be deployed to an intermediate staging environment. This will allow testing of security features, as well as checking to see that the code integrates with the entire system. Using third-party libraries and software development kits (SDKs) can help reduce errors and vulnerabilities in the code. Sandboxing is used to isolate a particular environment, and virtualization will not mitigate this risk. Even if the production server is virtualized, the risks are the same. Finally, deployment policies are a good idea, but they are not the most effective way to mitigate this particular risk."
Objective-2,39,CH2_SEIDL,Ian is concerned about VoIP phones used in his organization due to the use of SMS as part of their multifactor authentication rollout. What type attack should he be concerned about?    ,,A. A vishing attack  , B. A voicemail hijack  , C. An SMS token redirect  , D. A weak multifactor code injection ,C,"Ian should be concerned that attackers might be able to redirect short message service (SMS) messages sent to VoIP phones. This potential issue is one reason that some multifactor deployments do not allow SMS messages to be sent to VoIP phones in the environment, and some organizations do not allow SMS as an option, instead requiring hardware tokens or application-based multifactor authentication. Vishing is a type of phishing done via voice, voicemail hijacking would redirect voicemail to another mailbox by forwarding calls, and weak multifactor code injection was made up for this question."
Objective-2,40,CH2_SEIDL,Angela wants to ensure that IoT devices in her organization have a secure configuration when they are deployed and that they are ready for further configuration for their specific purposes. What term is used to describe these standard configurations used as part of her configuration management program?   ,,A. A baseline configuration  , B. An essential settings list  , C. A preinstall checklist  , D. A setup guide ,A,"Baseline configurations, per NIST 800-53: “Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline configurations include information about information system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational information systems change over time.  Baseline configurations of information systems reflect the current enterprise architecture.”"
Objective-2,41,CH2_SEIDL,"Why is heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) part of organizational security planning?    ",,A. Attackers often use HVAC systems as part of social engineering exercises.  , B. HVAC systems are important for availability.  , C. HVAC systems are a primary line of network defense.  , D. None of the above ,B,"HVAC systems are an important part of the availability for systems and infrastructure.  They are also a target for attackers who target Internet of Things (IoT) or network-connected devices. They are not frequent targets for use in social engineering efforts, although they could be used that way. They are not a primary line of defense for organizations."
Objective-2,42,CH2_SEIDL,What advantage does symmetric encryption have over asymmetric encryption? ,,A. It is more secure.  , B. It is faster.  , C. It can use longer keys.  , D. It simplifies key distributions. ,B,"Symmetric encryption is typically faster than asymmetric encryption. This is why many protocols use asymmetric encryption to exchange a symmetric key, and then use that key for the rest of their transaction. It is not more secure, key length is not a meaningful difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and key distribution for symmetric encryption is more challenging for larger populations using symmetric encryption if confidentiality needs to be maintained because every potential pair of communicators would need a different symmetric key."
Objective-2,43,CH2_SEIDL,Laura knows that predictability is a problem in pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) used for encryption operations. What term describes the measure of uncertainty used to a PRNG?   ,,A. Ellipses  , B. Quantum flux  , C. Entropy  , D. Primeness ,C,"Entropy is a measure of uncertainty. Having sources of entropy (or randomness) is a key element in a PRNG. Some pseudo-random number generators rely on input from keyboards, mice, or other human-generated inputs to have a source of entropy data."
Objective-2,44,CH2_SEIDL,Which cloud service model gives the consumer the ability to use applications provided by the cloud provider over the Internet?    ,,A. SaaS  , B. PaaS  , C. IaaS  , D. Hybrid ,A,"With the software as a service (SaaS) model, the consumer has the ability to use applications provided by the cloud provider over the Internet. SaaS is a subscription service where software is licensed on a subscription basis. Platform as a service (PaaS) provides the framework and underlying tools to build applications and services. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provides the components of an entire network and systems infrastructure. Hybrid models use both cloud and locally hosted systems."
Objective-2,45,CH2_SEIDL,Chris sets a resource policy in his cloud environment. What type of control does this allow him to exert?    ,,A. It allows him to determine how much disk space can be used.  , B. It allows him to determine how much bandwidth can be used.  , C. It allows him to specify who has access to resources and what actions they can perform to  it. , D. It allows him to specify what actions a resource can take on specific users. ,C,Resource policies are associated with a resource and allow you to determine which principals have access to that resource as well as what actions they can take on it. Resource policies are not used to set consumption limits.
Objective-2,46,CH2_SEIDL,Chris sets up SAN replication for his organization. What has he done? ,,A. He has enabled RAID 1 to ensure that the SAN cannot lose data if a drive fails because the drives are replicated. , B. He has set up backups to a tape library for the SAN to ensure data resilience.  , C. He has built a second identical set of hardware for his SAN.  , D. He has replicated the data on one SAN to another at the block or hardware level. ,D,"Storage area network (SAN) replication copies the contents of one repository to another repository, such as an organization’s central SAN environment to a remote SAN at the hardware or block level."
Objective-2,47,CH2_SEIDL,Mike is a security analyst and has just removed malware from a virtual server. What feature of virtualization would he use to return the virtual server to a last known good state?    ,,A. Sandboxing  , B. Hypervisor  , C. Snapshot  , D. Elasticity ,C,"A snapshot is an image of the virtual machine (VM) at some point in time. It is standard practice to periodically take a snapshot of a virtual system so that you can return that system to a last known good state. Sandboxing is the process of isolating a system or software.  The hypervisor is the mechanism through which the virtual environment interacts with the hardware, and elasticity is the ability for the system to scale."
Objective-2,48,CH2_SEIDL,"Lisa is concerned about fault tolerance for her database server. She wants to ensure that if any single drive fails, it can be recovered. What RAID level would support this goal while using distributed parity bits?   ",,A. RAID 0  , B. RAID 1  , C. RAID 3  , D. RAID 5 ,D,RAID level 5 is disk striping with distributed parity. It can withstand the loss of any single disk. RAID 0 is disk striping; it does not provide any fault tolerance. RAID 1 is mirroring. It does protect against the loss of a single disk but not with distributed parity. RAID 3 is disk striping with dedicated parity. This means a dedicated drive containing all the parity bits.
Objective-2,49,CH2_SEIDL,Jarod is concerned about EMI affecting a key escrow server. Which method would be most effective in mitigating this risk?    ,,A. VLAN  , B. SDN  , C. Trusted platform module  , D. Faraday cage ,D,"A Faraday cage, named after physicist Michael Faraday, involves placing wire mesh around an area or device to block electromagnetic signals. A VLAN can segment a network but won’t block electromagnetic interference (EMI). Software-defined networking (SDN) virtualizes a network but does not protect against EMI. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is used for cryptographic applications."
Objective-2,50,CH2_SEIDL,John is responsible for physical security at his company. He is particularly concerned about an attacker driving a vehicle into the building. Which of the following would provide the best protection against this threat?   ,,A. A gate  , B. Bollards  , C. A security guard on duty  , D. Security cameras ,B,"The correct answer is bollards. These are large objects, often made of concrete or similar material, designed specifically to prevent a vehicle getting past them. Most gates can be breached with a vehicle. A security guard is a good idea, but they would not be able to stop a vehicle from ramming the building. Security cameras will provide evidence of a crime that was committed but won’t prevent the crime."
Objective-2,51,CH2_SEIDL,"Mark is responsible for cybersecurity at a small college. There are many computer labs that are open for students to use. These labs are monitored only by a student worker, who may or may not be very attentive. Mark is concerned about the theft of computers. Which of the following would be the best way for him to mitigate this threat?   ",,A. Cable locks  , B. FDE on the lab computers  , C. Strong passwords on the lab computers  , D. Having a lab sign-in sheet ,A,"Attaching cable locks to the computers and locking them to the table will make it more difficult for someone to steal a computer. Full-disk encryption (FDE) won’t stop someone from stealing the computer, nor will strong passwords. A sign-in sheet is a good idea and may deter some thefts, but it is not the best approach to stopping theft offered in this scenario."
Objective-2,52,CH2_SEIDL,Joanne is responsible for security at a power plant. The facility is very sensitive and security is extremely important. She wants to incorporate two-factor authentication with physical security. What would be the best way to accomplish this?   ,,A. Smartcards  , B. A mantrap with a smartcard at one door and a PIN keypad at the other door  , C. A mantrap with video surveillance  , D. A fence with a smartcard gate access ,B,"The correct answer is to incorporate two-factor authentication with a mantrap. By having a smartcard at one door (type II authentication) and a PIN number (type I authentication) at the other door, Joanne will combine strong two-factor authentication with physical security.  Smartcards by themselves, or paired with a fence, are still single-factor authentication. Video surveillance, though often a good idea, won’t help with two-factor authentication."
Objective-2,53,CH2_SEIDL,Which of the following terms refers to the process of establishing a standard for security? ,,A. Baselining  , B. Security evaluation  , C. Hardening  , D. Normalization ,A,"Baselining is the process of establishing a standard for security. A change from the original baseline configuration is referred to as baseline deviation. Security evaluations or audits check security but don’t establish security standards. Hardening is the process of securing a given system, but it does not establish security standards. Normalization is the process of removing redundant entries from a database."
Objective-2,54,CH2_SEIDL,"Angela configures a honeypot to ongoing events like user logins and logouts, disk usage, program and script loads, and similar information. What is this type of deception called?    ",,A. Fake telemetry  , B. User emulation  , C. Honeyfakes  , D. Deepfakes ,A,Fake telemetry is telemetry created to make an attacker believe that a honeypot system is a legitimate system. Building a believable honeypot requires making the system as realistic as possible. Deepfakes are artificial intelligence (AI)-created videos that make it appear that individuals are saying or doing actions they never actually performed. The rest of the options were made up for this question.
Objective-2,55,CH2_SEIDL,Which level of RAID is a “stripe of mirrors”? ,,A. RAID 1+0  , B. RAID 6  , C. RAID 0  , D. RAID 1 ,A,"RAID 1+0, or RAID 10, is a mirrored data set (RAID 1), which is then striped (RAID 0): a “stripe of mirrors.” RAID 6 is disk striping with dual parity (distributed), RAID 0 is just striping, and RAID 1 is just mirroring."
Objective-2,56,CH2_SEIDL,Isabella is responsible for database management and security. She is attempting to remove redundancy in the database. What is this process called?    ,,A. Integrity checking  , B. Deprovisioning  , C. Baselining  , D. Normalization ,D,"Normalization is the process of removing duplication or redundant data from a database.  There are typically four levels of normalization ranging from 1N at the lowest (i.e., the most duplication) to 4N at the highest (i.e., the least duplication). Although database integrity is important, that is not what is described in the question. Furthermore, integrity checking usually refers to checking the integrity of files. Deprovisioning is a virtualization term for removing a virtual system (server, workstation, etc.) and reclaiming those resources, and in the context of identity management means removing an account or permissions. Baselining involves setting security standards."
Objective-2,57,CH2_SEIDL,Gary wants to implement an AAA service. Which of the following services should he implement?    ,,A. OpenID  , B. LDAP  , C. RADIUS  , D. SAML ,C,"Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) provides authentication, authorization, and accounting, which make up the three critical elements in AAA systems. OpenID is a protocol for authentication but does not provide authorization by itself. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a directory service, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a markup language for making security assertions."
Objective-2,58,CH2_SEIDL,"Where does TLS/SSL inspection happen, and how does it occur? ",,"A. On the client, using a proxy  "," B. On the server, using a protocol analyzer  "," C. At the certificate authority, by validating a request for a TLS certificate  ", D. Between the client and server by intercepting encrypted communications ,D,"TLS inspection (often called SSL inspection because the term SSL remains widely, if incorrectly, in use) involves intercepting encrypted traffic between the client and server. TLS interception devices act as an on-path attack and decrypt traffic to scan and analyze it, often for malware or other signs of attacks, and then encrypt it to send it on to its destination. As you might expect, TLS inspection has both legitimate and malicious uses."
Objective-2,59,CH2_SEIDL,Diana wants to prevent drones from flying over her organization’s property. What can she do?    ,,A. Deploy automated drone take-down systems that will shoot the drones down.  , B. Deploy radio frequency jamming systems to disrupt the drone’s control frequencies.  , C. Contact the FAA to get her company’s property listed as a no-fly zone.  , D. None of the above ,D,"In most cases none of these options are practical. Destruction of drones is an illegal destruction of private property. Jamming the open frequencies used for drones is not permissible and may result in action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and contacting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to request that the airspace above a company be declared a no-fly zone is not something the FAA supports in most cases. This means that Diana is likely to have to deal with the potential for drone-based threats in other ways."
Objective-2,60,CH2_SEIDL,"Isaac has configured an infrastructure-as-code-based cloud environment that relies on codedefined system builds to spin up new systems as the services they run need to scale horizontally. An attacker discovers a vulnerability and exploits a system in the cluster, but it is shut down and terminated before they can perform a forensic analysis. What term describes this type of environment?   ",,A. Forensic-resistant  , B. Nonpersistent  , C. Live-boot  , D. Terminate and stay resident ,B,"Isaac has built and configured a system where nonpersistence of systems can create forensic challenges. His organization needs to consider how they can make copies of compromised or problematic ephemeral systems and store them in a safe location for forensic analysis. This is not a forensic-resistant system—if he had a copy, he would have been able to analyze it. Live-boot media is not mentioned or used in this example, and terminate and stay resident (TSR) is a type of program run in the DOS operating system that returned control to the operating system but remained in memory so that it could be easily run again as needed."
Objective-2,61,CH2_SEIDL,"You are responsible for database security at your company. You are concerned that programmers might pass badly written SQL commands to the database, or that an attacker might exploit badly written SQL in applications. What is the best way to mitigate this threat?    ",,A. Formal code inspection  , B. Programming policies  , C. Agile programming  , D. Stored procedures ,D,"Stored procedures are the best way to have standardized SQL. Rather than programmers writing their own SQL commands, they simply call the stored procedures that the database administrator creates. Formal code inspection might detect a lack of security practices and defenses but won’t stop SQL-based attacks. Policies requiring stored procedures might help but are a less direct path to the solution. Finally, agile programming is a method for developing applications rapidly and won’t determine how SQL commands are created."
Objective-2,62,CH2_SEIDL,Joanna’s company has adopted multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) tools and now wants to better coordinate them so that the data that they each contain can be used in multiple services. What type of solution should she recommend if she wants to minimize the complexity of long-term maintenance for her organizatio ?  ,,A. Replace the SaaS service with a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environment to move everything to a single platform.  , B. Build API-based integrations using in-house expertise.  , C. Adopt an integration platform to leverage scalability.  , D. Build flat-file integrations using in-house expertise. ,C,"Services integration in cloud and virtualization environments can be very complex and can involve data, APIs, and other types of application integration. Integration platforms allow organizations to use a standardized tool rather than building and maintaining their own. This allows them to focus on the actual integrations rather than the underlying system, saving time and effort. Since integration platforms also often have preexisting tools for common services and APIs, they can save significant amounts of time for organizations that adopt them. Of course, this also introduces another platform to assess and secure."
Objective-2,63,CH2_SEIDL,"Farès is responsible for managing the many virtual machines on his company’s networks. Over the past two years, the company has increased the number of virtual machines significantly. Farès is no longer able to effectively manage the large number of machines. What is the term for this situation?   ",,A. VM overload  , B. VM sprawl  , C. VM spread  , D. VM zombies ,B,"When virtualization reaches the point that IT can no longer effectively manage it, the condition is known as VM sprawl. VM overload and VM spread are made up for this question, and a VM zombie is a term for a virtual machine that is running and consuming resources but no longer has a purpose."
Objective-2,64,CH2_SEIDL,Mary is responsible for virtualization management in her company. She is concerned about VM escape. Which of the following methods would be the most effective in mitigating this risk?   ,,A. Only share resources between the VM and host if absolutely necessary.  , B. Keep the VM patched.  , C. Use a firewall on the VM.  , D. Use host-based antimalware on the VM. ,A,"VM escape is a situation wherein an attacker is able to go through the VM to interact directly with the hypervisor and potentially the host operating system. The best way to prevent this is to limit the ability of the host and the VM to share resources. If possible, they should not share any resources. Patching might mitigate the situation, but it is not the most effective solution. Using firewalls and antimalware tools is a good security practice but would have minimal effect on mitigating VM escape."
Objective-2,65,CH2_SEIDL,"Irene wants to use a cloud service for her organization that does not require her to do any coding or system administration, and she wants to do minimal configuration to perform the tasks that her organization needs to accomplish. What type of cloud service is she most likely looking fo ?     ",,A. SaaS  , B. PaaS  , C. IaaS  , D. IDaaS ,A,"Irene is looking for a software-as-a-service (SaaS) tool that allows her to perform the specific function that her organization needs to accomplish. An SaaS service does not require system administration or programming and typically requires minimal configuration to perform its normal functionality. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) typically requires some configuration or programming, and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) will require systems administration, programming, or configuration—or all three! Identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) is a specific type of solution that was not described as part of Irene’s needs."
Objective-2,66,CH2_SEIDL,Which of the following is not an advantage of a serverless architectur ? ,,A. It does not require a system administrator.  , B. It can scale as function call frequency increases.  , C. It can scale as function call frequency decreases.  , D. It is ideal for complex applications. ,D,"Serverless architectures do not require a system administrator because the provider manages the underlying function-as-a-service (FaaS) capability. It can also scale up or scale down as needed, allowing it to be very flexible. Serverless architectures are typically not ideal for complex applications and instead tend to work better for microservices."
Objective-2,67,CH2_SEIDL,You are responsible for server room security for your company. You are concerned about physical theft of the computers. Which of the following would be best able to detect theft or attempted theft?   ,,A. Motion sensor–activated cameras  , B. Smartcard access to the server rooms  , C. Strong deadbolt locks for the server rooms  , D. Logging everyone who enters the server room ,A,"The correct answer is to have a motion-activated camera that records everyone who enters the server room. Motion recognition is an important feature in this type of scenario, where cameras operate in a space where there is little physical traffic and storage would be wasted by recording empty, unused spaces. Smartcards, deadbolts, and logging won’t detect theft."
Objective-2,68,CH2_SEIDL,Alexandra wants to prevent systems that are infected with malware from connecting to a botnet controller that she knows the hostnames for. What type of solution can she implement to prevent the systems from reaching the controller?   ,,A. An IDS  , B. A round-robin DNS  , C. A DNS sinkhole  , D. A WAF ,C,"A Domain Name System (DNS) sinkhole is a DNS server used to spoof DNS servers that would normally resolve an unwanted to malicious hostname. Traffic can be sent to a legitimate system, causing warnings to appear on the user’s screen, or simply sent to a null route or nonexistent system. An intrusion detection system (IDS) cannot stop traffic, round-robin DNS is a way to spread DNS traffic, and a WAF is a web application firewall, and nothing in this question indicates that there is a web-specific issue."
Objective-2,69,CH2_SEIDL,Hector is using infrared cameras to verify that servers in his datacenter are being properly racked. Which of the following datacenter elements is he concerned about?    ,,A. EMI blocking  , B. Humidity control  , C. Hot and cold aisles  , D. UPS failover ,C,"Hot aisle/cold aisle is a layout design for server racks and other computing equipment in a datacenter. The goal of a hot aisle/cold aisle configuration is to conserve energy and lower cooling costs by managing airflow. An infrared camera will detect heat levels on the aisles.  Although the rest of the options are potential issues for a datacenter, an infrared camera won’t help with them."
Objective-2,70,CH2_SEIDL,Gerald is concerned about unauthorized people entering the company’s building. Which of the following would be most effective in preventing this?    ,,A. Alarm systems  , B. Fencing  , C. Cameras  , D. Security guards ,D,"A security guard is the most effective way to prevent unauthorized access to a building.  Options A, B, and C are all incorrect. These are all good physical security measures, but they are not the most effective ways to prevent entry into a building."

It will prevent session hijacking. ,B,"Software-defined networking (SDN) makes the network very scalable. It is relatively easy to add on new resources or remove unneeded resources, and it helps with high availability efforts. SDN does not stop malware, detect intrusions, or prevent session hijacking."
Objective-2,72,CH2_SEIDL,"Mark is an administrator for a health care company. He has to support an older, legacy application. He is concerned that this legacy application might have vulnerabilities that would affect the rest of the network. What is the most efficient way to mitigate this?    ",,A. Use an application container.  , B. Implement SDN.  , C. Run the application on a separate VLAN.  , D. Insist on an updated version of the application. ,A,"The correct answer is to use an application container to isolate that application from the host operating system. Application containers provide a virtualized environment in which to run an application. Moving to software-defined networking (SDN) is a very involved process and does not provide an efficient solution. Running the application in a separate VLAN will not separate the application from the host operating system; it might not solve the problem. Since this is a legacy application, insisting on an updated version of the application isn’t feasible."
Objective-2,73,CH2_SEIDL,"Charles is performing a security review of an internally developed web application. During his review, he notes that the developers who wrote the application have made use of thirdparty libraries. What risks should he note as part of his review?    ",,A.

A set of tightly coupled services with custom-designed protocols to ensure continuous operation , D. A set of services using third-party applications in a connected network enabled with industry standard protocols,A,"Microservice architectures build applications as a set of loosely coupled services that provide specific functions using lightweight protocols. It doesn’t specifically define the size of the systems, but it is not a tightly coupled environment. Protocol choice is often open standardsbased, but the emphasis is on lightweight protocols. There is not a requirement that services be in-house or third party exclusively."
Objective-2,76,CH2_SEIDL,"Abigail is responsible for datacenters in a large, multinational company. She has to support multiple datacenters in diverse geographic regions. What would be the most effective way for her to manage these centers consistently across the enterprise?   ",,A. Hire datacenter managers for each center.  , B. Implement enterprise-wide SDN.  , C. Implement infrastructure as code (IaC).  , D. Automate provisioning and deprovisioning. ,C,"The correct answer is to implement IaC. Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer datacenters through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. Whether the datacenter(s) use physical machines or virtual machines, this is an effective way to manage the datacenters. Although datacenter managers may be needed, that won’t necessarily provide consistent management across the enterprise. Software-defined networking (SDN) will not fix this problem, but it would help if she needed to configure and manage her network based on usage and performance. Finally, this issue is not just about provisioning; it is about management."

The printers could be used as part of a DDoS attack.  , C. The printers may allow attackers to access other parts of the company network.  , D. The scanners may be accessed to allow attackers to scan documents that are left in them. ,C,"In this scenario Greg should identify the use of the printers for further attacks against the organization as the most critical risk. Use as part of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack does not directly impact the organization in most cases, exhausting supplies would be an annoyance, and the risk of scanning documents from a remote location requires sensitive documents to be left in the MFPs. Greg should note that all of these issues could be problems and move the MFPs to a protected network so that third parties can’t access them."

Cloud and virtualization implementations of this providing virtual desktops are called VDI, or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, but do not necessarily require a thin client, since they can work on a fully capable computer (or thick client). Client-as-a-server is a made-up term."
Objective-2,80,CH2_SEIDL,Keith has deployed computers to users in his company that load their resources from a central server environment rather than from their own hard drives. What term describes this model?   ,,A. The image is used as decryption key.  , B. The code is hidden in the image using steganography.  , C. The code is encoded as text in the image.  , D. The image is a control command from a malware command and control network. ,B,"This real-world example was found in 2020 when malicious PowerShell code was discovered that triple-encoded malicious tools. The initial package was downloaded as an image from imgur.com or similar sites and was concealed using steganographic techniques. The code was also encrypted using RSA and encoded in Base64 both prior to encryption and again after encryption. Although steganography is not incredibly common, Henry should suspect that a downloaded image may be more than it appears."

Require HTTPs for all authenticated pages.  , C. Ensure tokens are not disclosed in public source code.  , D. Hash passwords using a salt. ,A,"Storing data in plain text will not help prevent data exposure and, in fact, is more likely to result in data exposure. Instead, Molly should encourage her developers to store and transmit sensitive data in an encrypted form. They should also leverage HTTPS for all authenticated pages, and potentially all pages. Hashing passwords using salts is important for password security, and ensuring that tokens are not exposed via sites like GitHub or other public code repositories is important for application and data security."
Objective-2,82,CH2_SEIDL,Molly wants to advise her organization’s developers on secure coding techniques to avoid data exposure. Which of the following is not a common technique used to prevent sensitive data exposure?   ,,A. Disable the web browser.  , B. Install a host firewall.  , C. Use secure firmware.  , D. Install antimalware software. ,C,"Using secure firmware, as well as using an RTOS with time and space partitioning, are both common methods to help ensure RTOS security. Unlike traditional operating systems, real-time operating systems are used in applications where they need to deal with inputs immediately. That means that adding additional load like firewalls and antimalware is not a typical component in RTOS applications. For similar reasons, you’re unlikely to find a web browser on most devices running an RTOS."
Objective-2,83,CH2_SEIDL,Naomi wants to secure a real-time operating system (RTOS). Which of the following techniques is best suited to providing RTOS security? ,,A. Buffer overflow  , B. Code reuse attack  , C. DoS attack  , D. Session hijacking ,B,"In a code reuse attack, the attacker executes code that is meant for some other purposes.  In many cases this can be old code that is no longer even used (dead code), even if that code is in a third-party library. A buffer overflow occurs when too much data is sent to a buffer.  For example, say a buffer is designed to hold 10 bytes, and it is sent 100 bytes, causing the additional data to be put into unexpected memory locations. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is meant to make a service or system unavailable to legitimate users. Session hijacking involves taking over an existing authenticated session."

Cloud backups to a cold repository are increasingly popular options and may be faster for some retrieval scenarios, but they are not listed as options. Storage area network (SAN) and network-attached storage (NAS) devices are not commonly used for cold backup and are instead used for online or nearline options. Disk backup could be used but remains less common than tape for a true cold backup scenario."
Objective-2,88,CH2_SEIDL,Nathan wants to implement off-site cold backups. What backup technology is most commonly used for this type of need?    ,,"A. Back up to a second datacenter in another building nearby, allowing reduced latency for backups. ", B. Back up to an off-site location at least 90 miles away to ensure that a natural disaster does not destroy both copies. , C. Back up to a second datacenter in another building nearby to ensure that the data will be  accessible if the power fails to the primary building. , D. Back up to an off-site location at least 10 miles away to balance latency and resilience due to natural disaster.,B,"Off-site storage has to balance availability and the ability to be used in the event that a disaster or other event occurs. In this case, Allan should look at a facility far enough away that a single disaster cannot take both sites offline."
Objective-2,89,CH2_SEIDL,"Allan is considering implementing off-site storage. When he does, his datacenter manager offers four solutions. Which of these solutions will best ensure resilience and why?    ",,A. Limited processor power  , B. An inability to patch  , C. Lack of authentication capabilities  , D. Lack of bulk storage ,D,"Embedded systems can bring a broad range of security implications, many of which are driven by the limited capabilities of the processors and hardware they are frequently built with. Low-power consumption designs may lack computational power and thus have challenges implementing strong cryptography, network connectivity, and other similar problems.  Patching embedded systems can be challenging both because of where they are deployed and because of a lack of connectivity for them—in fact, in many environments, you may not want the devices to be connected to your network. Since many don’t have a screen, keyboard, or a network connection, authentication is also a problem. Few embedded devices, however, need bulk storage, making the lack of bulk storage a problem that typically isn’t a major concern."
Objective-2,90,CH2_SEIDL,Ben has been asked to explain the security implications for an embedded system that his organization is considering building and selling. Which of the following is not a typical concern for embedded systems?    ,,A. Using a TPM  , B. Ensuring each has its own cryptographic key  , C. Using SED  , D. Using BIOS protection ,B,"System on a chip (SoC) devices are complete self-contained systems on a single chip.  Therefore, having their own unique cryptographic keys is the best way to implement authentication and security. Option A is incorrect. A system on a chip is self-contained, so a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) would not be an appropriate solution. Option C is incorrect. A selfencrypting drive (SED) is not relevant to system on a chip, since that system does not have a “drive.” Option D is incorrect. Many SoC technologies don’t use a BIOS."
Objective-2,91,CH2_SEIDL,You are concerned about the security of new devices your company has implemented. Some of these devices use SoC technology. What would be the best security measure you could take for these?   ,,A. Ensure all communications with the device are encrypted.  , B. Ensure the devices have FDE.  , C. Ensure the devices have individual antimalware.  , D. Ensure the devices have been fuzz-tested. ,A,"Such systems need to have all communications encrypted. As of the current date, breaches of portable network devices have all involved unencrypted communications. Option B is incorrect. Full-disk encryption (FDE) may or may not even be appropriate for such devices. Many don’t have a disk to encrypt. Option C is incorrect. It may not be possible to install antimalware on many such devices. Option D is incorrect. Fuzz testing is used for applications."
Objective-2,92,CH2_SEIDL,"Vincent works for a company that manufactures portable medical devices, such as insulin pumps. He is concerned about ensuring these devices are secure. Which of the following is the most important step for him to take?    ",,A. UAV  , B. Automobiles  , C. Airplanes  , D. All of the above ,D,"The more vehicles utilize computers and have network communication capabilities, the more they will be vulnerable to cyberattacks. Options A, B, and C are all incorrect, as all of these are concerns rather than just one."
Objective-2,93,CH2_SEIDL,Emile is concerned about securing the computer systems in vehicles. Which of the following vehicle types has significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities?    ,,A. She can review the source code.  , B. She can test the application in a live environment.  , C. She can check the checksums provided by the vendor.  , D. None of the above ,A,"An advantage of compiling software is that you can perform static code analysis. That means Amanda can review the source code for flaws and could even remediate flaws if they were found. Both binaries and compiled code can be tested in a live environment (dynamic analysis), and checksums for both can be validated."
Objective-2,94,CH2_SEIDL,What additional security control can Amanda implement if she uses compiled software that she cannot use if she only has software binaries?    ,,A. An RFC  , B. Wikipedia  , C. The Internet Archive  , D. None of the above ,A,"RFCs, or requests for comment, are how Internet protocols are defined and documented.  Wikipedia is not the definitive resource, and the Internet Archive actively archives the Internet but does not define protocols."
Objective-2,95,CH2_SEIDL,"Greta wants to understand how a protocol works, including what values should be included in packets that use that protocol. Where is this data definitively defined and documented?    ",,A. It can help administrators determine the function of a system.  , B. It can help administrators identify misconfigured or rogue systems.  , C. It can help conceal systems from attackers.  , D. It can make scripting easier. ,C,"Standard naming conventions typically do not help to conceal systems from attackers.  Attackers can still scan for systems and may even be able to use the naming convention to identify the purpose of a system if the naming convention includes a purpose or technology in the name. Naming conventions do make standardization easier and can help administrators quickly identify what a machine does, while making it simpler to include systems in scripts. A machine that doesn’t match is likely to be a rogue or misconfigured."
Objective-2,96,CH2_SEIDL,Using standard naming conventions provides a number of advantages. Which of the following is not an advantage of using a naming convention?    ,,A. A continuous monitoring environment  , B. A CI/CD pipeline  , C. A static code analysis system  , D. A malware analysis process ,B,"This is an example of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.  There is no mention of monitoring systems, and although code analysis is happening here in testing, it is dynamic testing, not source code analysis. There is no mention of malware in the pipeline."

Voiceprint analysis  , C. Fingerprint analysis  , D. Gait analysis ,D,"Although gait analysis is not commonly used for identification and authorization purposes, it is used in situations where crowd footage is available to identify individuals. Vein, voiceprint, and fingerprint analysis are not useful in most scenarios involving heavily used and crowded spaces."
Objective-2,98,CH2_SEIDL,Your company is interested in keeping data in the cloud. Management feels that public clouds are not secure but is concerned about the cost of a priva e cloud. What is the solution you would recommend?     ,,A. Tell them there are no risks with public clouds.  , B. Tell them they will have to find a way to budget for a private cloud.  , C. Suggest that they consider a community cloud.  , D. Recommend against a cloud solution at this time. ,C,"A community cloud presents a compromise solution. Community clouds are semi-private.  They are not accessible to the general public but only to a small community of specific entities. There are risks with public clouds, as there are with any environment. Private clouds can be quite expensive to build out, particularly for smaller organizations that cannot afford staffing or hardware. Finally, recommending against a cloud solution does not match the company’s stated goal."
Objective-2,99,CH2_SEIDL,"Your development team primarily uses Windows, but they need to develop a specific solution that will run on Linux. What is the best solution to get your programmers access to Linux systems for development and testing if you want to use a cloud solution where you could run the final systems in production as wel ?     ",,A. Set their machines to dual-boot Windows and Linux.  , B. Use PaaS.  , C. Set up a few Linux machines for them to work with as needed.  , D. Use IaaS. ,D,"Using infrastructure as a service (IaaS) makes the most sense here; it meets the cloud requirement described and would allow additional systems to be quickly created or removed as needed. Platform as a service (PaaS) does not provide direct access to Linux systems to build out applications and related configuration. Setting up dual boot and building machines are not cloud solutions as described. When you answer questions like this, make sure you read and meet all the requirements in the question."
Objective-2,100,CH2_SEIDL,"Corrine has been asked to automate security responses, including blocking IP addresses from which attacks are detected using a series of scripts. What critical danger should she consider while building the scripts for her organization?    ",,A. The scripts could cause an outage.  , B. The scripts may not respond promptly to private IP addresses.  , C. Attackers could use the scripts to attack the organization.  , D. Auditors may not allow the scripts. ,A,"One of the dangers of automation and scripting is that the scripts will do exactly what they are written to do. That means that a script like those that Corrine has been asked to write that doesn’t have rules that prevent it from blocking critical systems could block those systems. There is no indication in the question of any issues with private IP addresses, and filtering them would require more work. Attackers could potentially use the scripts if they discovered them, but if they’re able to access security scripts there is likely a deeper problem. Finally, auditors typically do not review scripts and instead ask about the existence of controls."
Objective-2,101,CH2_SEIDL,Madhuri has configured a backup that will back up all of the changes to a system since the last time that a full backup occurred. What type of backup has she set up?    ,,A. A snapshot  , B. A full backup  , C. An incremental backup  , D. A differential ,D,"Differential backups back up all of the changes since the last full backup. An incremental backup backs up all changes since the last incremental backup. A snapshot captures machine state and the full drive at a bitwise level, and full backups are a complete copy of a system but typically do not include the memory state."
Objective-2,102,CH2_SEIDL,"You are the CIO for a small company. The company wants to use cloud storage for some of its data, but cost is a major concern. Which of the following cloud deployment models would be best?    ",,A. Community cloud  , B. Private cloud  , C. Public cloud  , D. Hybrid cloud ,C,"The correct answer is a public cloud. Public clouds are usually less expensive. The cloud provider has a number of customers and costs are dispersed. Even individuals can afford to use cloud storage with services like iCloud and Amazon Cloud. A community cloud is usually private for a small group of partners. Each of the partners must share a greater part of the expense than they would with a public cloud, but they retain more control over the cloud than they would with a public cloud. Private clouds are often the most expensive for smaller organizations. The company must completely develop and maintain the cloud resources and cannot leverage shared resources. A hybrid deployment model is a good compromise for many situations, but it will typically be more expensive than a public cloud for a small organization."
Objective-2,103,CH2_SEIDL,What is the point where false acceptance rate and false rejection rate cross over in a biometric system?  ,,A. CRE  , B. FRE  , C. CER  , D. FRR ,C,"The crossover error rate (CER) is the point where the FAR (false acceptance rate) and the FRR (false rejection rate) cross over. CER provides a means of comparing biometric systems based on their efficiency, with a lower CER being more desirable."
Objective-2,104,CH2_SEIDL,Devin is building a cloud system and wants to ensure that it can adapt to changes in its workload by provisioning or deprovisioning resources automatically. His goal is to ensure that the environment is not overprovisioned or underprovisioned and that he is efficiently spending money on his infrastructure. What concept describes thi ?     ,,A. Vertical scalability  , B. Elasticity  , C. Horizontal scalability  , D. Normalization ,B,Elasticity is a cloud computing concept that matches resources to demand to ensure that an infrastructure closely matches the needs of the environment. Scalability is the ability to grow or shrink as needed but does not directly include the concept of matching to workload. Normalization is a code development concept used to ensure that data is in a consistent form.
Objective-2,105,CH2_SEIDL,"Nathaniel wants to improve the fault tolerance of a server in his datacenter. If he wants to ensure that a power outage does not cause the server to lose power, what is the first control he should deploy from the following list?    ",,A. A UPS  , B. A generator  , C. Dual power supplies  , D. Managed power units (PDUs) ,A,"An uninterruptable power supply (UPS) should be Nathaniel’s first priority. Ensuring that power is not disrupted during an outage and can be maintained for a short period until alternate power like a generator can come online is critical, and a UPS can provide that capability. A generator alone will take longer to come online, resulting in an outage. Dual power supplies can help to build resilience by allowing multiple power sources and avoiding issues if a power supply does fail, but that is not the focus of the question. A managed power distribution unit (PDU) provides remote management and power monitoring but will not prevent power loss in an outage."
Objective-2,106,CH2_SEIDL,Which of the following is the best description for VM sprawl?  ,,A. When VMs on your network outnumber physical machines  , B. When there are more VMs than IT can effectively manage  , C. When a VM on a computer begins to consume too many resources  , D. When VMs are spread across a wide area network ,B,Virtual machine (VM) sprawl refers to a situation in which the network has more virtual machines than the IT staff can effectively manage. The remaining options do not match the term VM sprawl.
Objective-2,107,CH2_SEIDL,Which of the following is the best description of a stored procedure? ,,"A. Code that is in a DLL, rather than the executable  ", B. Server-side code that is called from a client  , C. SQL statements compiled on the database server as a single procedure that can be called ," D. Procedures that are kept on a separate server from the calling application, such as in middleware",C,"Stored procedures are commonly used in many database management systems to contain SQL statements. The database administrator (DBA), or someone designated by the DBA, creates the various SQL statements that are needed in that business, and then programmers can simply call the stored procedures. Stored procedures are not related to dynamic linked libraries (DLLs). Stored procedures can be called by other stored procedures that are also on the server. Finally, stored procedures are not related to middleware."
Objective-2,108,CH2_SEIDL,Farès is responsible for security at his company. He has had bollards installed around the front of the building. What is Farès trying to accomplish?    ,,A. Gated access for people entering the building  , B. Video monitoring around the building  , C. Protecting against EMI  , D. Preventing a vehicle from being driven into the building ,D,Bollards are large barriers that are often made of strong substances like concrete. They are effective in preventing a vehicle from being driven into a building. None of the other answers match the purpose of a bollard.
Objective-2,109,CH2_SEIDL,The large company that Selah works at uses badges with a magnetic stripe for entry access. Which threat model should Selah be concerned about with badges like these?    ,,A. Cloning of badges  , B. Tailgating  , C. Use by unauthorized individuals  , D. All of the above ,D,"Selah should be concerned about cloning the badges because magnetic stripe badges are relatively simple to clone in most cases. Tailgating is common, particularly if there are large numbers of employees, since employees are unlikely to allow doors to close and then reopen them for every person who enters during shift changes. Since magnetic stripe readers do not require any additional information, use by unauthorized individuals is easy if a badge is lost or stolen."
Objective-2,110,CH2_SEIDL,You are concerned about VM escape attacks causing a significant data breach. Which of the following would provide the most protection against this?    ,,A. Separate VM hosts by data type or sensitivity.  , B. Install a host-based antivirus on both the VM and the host.  , C. Implement FDE on both the VM and the host.  , D. Use a TPM on the host. ,A,"Virtual machine (VM) escape attacks rely on a flaw in the hypervisor that could allow an attacker to attack the hypervisor itself. Typical system administration best practices can help, including regular patching of the hypervisor, but in the event of a successful escape attack, limiting damage by keeping VMs of the same sensitivity level isolated to the same host can prevent broader impact. Antivirus is always a good idea and may even stop some malware-based VM escape attacks, but isolating the VM is more effective. Full-disk encryption (FDE) will have no effect since the disk must be unencrypted during operation.  A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is used for storing cryptographic keys."
Objective-2,111,CH2_SEIDL,Teresa is the network administrator for a small company. The company is interested in a robust and modern network defense strategy but lacks the staff to support it. What would be the best solution for Teresa to use?    ,,A. Implement SDN.  , B. Use automated security.  , C. Use an MSSP.  , D. Implement only the few security controls they have the skills to implement. ,C,"Managed security service providers (MSSPs) are an outside company that handles security tasks. Some or even all security tasks can be outsourced, including intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS) management, security information and event management (SIEM) integration, and other security controls. Software-defined networking (SDN) would make managing security somewhat easier but would itself be difficult to implement. Automating as much security activity as is practical would help alleviate the problem but would not be as effective as security as a service. Finally, only implementing a few security controls would likely leave control gaps."
Objective-2,112,CH2_SEIDL,Dennis is trying to set up a system to analyze the integrity of applications on his network. He wants to make sure that the applications have not been tampered with or Trojaned. What would be most useful in accomplishing this goal?    ,,A. Implement NIPS.  , B. Use cryptographic hashes.  , C. Sandbox the applications in question.  , D. Implement NIDS. ,B,"Cryptographic hashes are used for integrity checking of files, network packets, and a variety of other applications. Storing a cryptographic hash of the application and comparing the application on the network to that hash will confirm (or refute) whether the application has been altered in any way. Network intrusion detection or network intrusion prevention systems (NIPSs/NIDSs) are useful, but they won’t prevent an application from being altered.  Sandboxing is used to isolate an application, but it won’t detect whether it has been tampered with."
Objective-2,113,CH2_SEIDL,"George is a network administrator at a power plant. He notices that several turbines had unusual ramp-ups in cycles last week. After investigating, he finds that an executable was uploaded to the system control console and caused this. Which of the following would be most effective in preventing this from affecting the SCADA system in the futur ?     ",,A. Implement SDN.  , B. Improve patch management.  , C. Place the SCADA system on a separate VLAN.  , D. Implement encrypted data transmissions. ,C,"Separating the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system from the main network makes it less likely that the SCADA system can be affected from the main network. This includes malware as well as human action. Software-defined networking (SDN) would make isolating the SCADA system easier but would not actually isolate it.  Patch management is always important, but in this case, it would not have prevented the issue. Encrypted data transmissions, such as TLS, would have no effect on this situation."
Objective-2,114,CH2_SEIDL,Gordon knows that regression testing is important but wants to prevent old versions of code from being re-inserted into new releases. What process should he use to prevent this?    ,,A. Continuous integration  , B. Version numbering  , C. Continuous deployment  , D. Release management ,B,"Gordon should implement a version numbering scheme and ensure that the proper current version of software components is included in new releases and deployments. Developers could still manually reintroduce old code, but version numbering helps to ensure that you have a current version in use. Neither continuous deployment nor continuous integration will prevent old code from being inserted, and release management may rely on version numbering but won’t prevent it by itself."
Objective-2,115,CH2_SEIDL,Mia is a network administrator for a bank. She is responsible for secure communications with her company’s customer website. Which of the following would be the best for her to implement?    ,,A. SSL  , B. PPTP  , C. IPSec  , D. TLS ,D,"Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides a reliable method of encrypting web traffic. It supports mutual authentication and is considered secure. Although Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) can encrypt web traffic, TLS was created in 1999 as its successor. Although many network administrators still use the term SSL, in most cases today what you are using is actually TLS, not the outdated SSL. PPTP and IPSec are protocols for establishing a VPN, not for encrypting web traffic."
Objective-2,116,CH2_SEIDL,Which of the following is not a common challenge with smartcard-based authentication s ystems?    ,,A. Weak security due to the limitations of the smartcard’s encryption support  ," B. Added expense due to card readers, distribution, and software installation  ", C. Weaker user experience due to the requirement to insert the card for every authentication  , D. Lack of security due to possession of the card being the only factor used ,A,"Smartcards can support modern cryptographic algorithms, meaning that weak security due to a smartcard’s limitations on encryption is not a common issue. Smartcard readers and maintenance do add additional expense, and user experiences are limited by the need to have the card in hand and insert it or present it to a reader either during authentication or for entire sessions. Smartcards typically have a PIN or password, meaning that they are used for multifactor, not single-factor, authentication."
Objective-2,117,CH2_SEIDL,"Susan’s secure building is equipped with alarms that go off if specific doors are opened. As part of a penetration test, Susan wants to determine if the alarms are effective. What technique is used by penetration testers to make alarms less effective?    ",,A. Setting off the alarms as part of a preannounced test  , B. Disabling the alarms and then opening doors to see if staff report the opened doors  , C. Asking staff members to open the doors to see if they will set the alarm off  , D. Setting off the alarms repeatedly so that staff become used to hearing them go off ,D,"Setting off an alarm so that staff become used to it being a false positive is a technique that penetration testers may use if they can gain access to a facility. Once staff are used to alarms going off and ignore it, the penetration testers can enter areas that are alarmed without a response occurring. Setting off the alarm as part of a test isn’t typical for penetration testers, and disabling the alarm and waiting for the lack of an alarm to be reported is also more likely to be part of an internal test, not a penetration test. Asking staff members to open the door is not a means of making alarms less effective, and staff members who know the door is alarmed are unlikely to do so."
Objective-2,118,CH2_SEIDL,What term is used to describe the general concept of “anything as a service”?  ,,A. AaaS  , B. ATaaS  , C. XaaS  , D. ZaaS ,C,"The term “XaaS” refers to anything as a service, a broad reference to the huge number of options that exist for services via third-party providers. The rest of the options for this question were made up for the question."
Objective-2,119,CH2_SEIDL,What role does signage play in building security?  ,,A. It is a preventive control warning unauthorized individuals away from secured areas.  ," B. It can help with safety by warning about dangerous areas, materials, or equipment.  ", C. It can provide directions for evacuation and general navigation.  , D. All of the above ,D,"Signage plays multiple roles in secure environments, including discouraging unwanted or unauthorized access, providing safety warnings, and helping with evacuation routes and other navigation information as part of a physical safety effort."
Objective-2,120,CH2_SEIDL,Nora has rented a building with access to bandwidth and power in case her organization ever experiences a disaster. What type of site has she established?    ,,A. A hot site  , B. A cold site  , C. A warm site  , D. A MOU site ,B,"Nora has established a cold site. A cold site is a location that can be brought online but does not have systems; cold sites typically have access to power and bandwidth, but they need to be fully equipped to operate after a disaster since they are just rented space. Warm sites have some or all of the infrastructure and systems Nora needs but does not have data.  A hot site is a fully functional environment with all of the hardware, software, and data needed to operate an organization. They are expensive to maintain and run but are used by organizations that cannot take the risk of downtime. A MOU is a memorandum of understanding and is not a type of disaster recovery site."
Objective-2,121,CH2_SEIDL,Matt is patching a Windows system and wants to have the ability to revert to a last known good configuration. What should he set?    ,,A. A system restore point  , B. A reversion marker  , C. A nonpersistent patch point  , D. A live boot marker ,A,Windows calls the point that it saves to return to a known good configuration a system restore point. Matt should set one prior to installing new software or patching if he is worried about what might occur. The rest of the options are not Windows terms.
Objective-2,122,CH2_SEIDL,Which multifactor authentication can suffer from problems if the system or device’s time is not correct?    ,,A. TOTP  , B. SMS  , C. HOTP  , D. MMAC ,A,"TOTP, or time-based one-time password, algorithms rely on the time being accurate between both of the authentication hosts. That means that if a system or device is not properly synced to an authoritative and correct time server, or if its local system time has drifted, the authentication may fail. Although TOTP systems have some flexibility, a clock that is sufficiently incorrect will cause an issue. HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP) and short message service (SMS)-based multifactor systems do not suffer from this issue, and MMAC was made up for this question."
Objective-2,123,CH2_SEIDL,The company that Nina works for has suffered from recent thefts of packages from a lowsecurity delivery area. What type of camera capability can they use to ensure that a recently delivered package is properly monitored?    ,,A. Infrared image capture  , B. Motion detection  , C. Object detection  , D. Facial recognition ,C,"Object detection capabilities can detect specific types or classes of objects and can be used to determine if the object is moved. In this case, Nina could enable object detection to notify her when packages are delivered, and she may be able to specifically select an object to monitor for additional security. Infrared capabilities are useful in low-light situations, motion detection helps to preserve storage space by only recording when motion occurs, and facial recognition could help identify specific individuals but won’t help with packages."
Objective-2,124,CH2_SEIDL,Which of the following is not a common organizational security concern for wearable devices?    ,,A. GPS location data exposure  , B. Data exposure  , C. User health data exposure  , D. Insecure wireless connectivity ,C,"Although user health data is a concern for the wearer of the device, unless the device is required by the organization, the user’s health data is typically not an organizational security concern. GPS location data, data exposure from data that is copied to or accessible from the device, and the potential for devices to act as unsecured wireless gateways to the organization’s network are all common security concerns for wearables. Lack of patching, lack of device encryption, and the inability to enforce compliance or security policies are also common concerns for wearables."
Objective-2,125,CH2_SEIDL,Tim is building a Faraday cage around his server room. What is the primary purpose of a Faraday cage?    ,,A. To regulate temperature  , B. To regulate current  , C. To block intrusions  , D. To block EMI ,D,A Faraday cage is a metal wire mesh designed to block electromagnetic interference (EMI). None of the other answers describe what a Faraday cage is used for or capable of.
Objective-2,126,CH2_SEIDL,You are working for a large company. You are trying to find a solution that will provide controlled physical access to the building and record every employee who enters the building. Which of the following would be the best for you to implement?    ,,A. A security guard with a sign-in sheet  , B. Smartcard access using electronic locks  , C. A camera by the entrance  , D. A sign-in sheet by the front door ,B,"Smartcards paired with electronic locks can be used to allow entrance into a building.  The smartcard system can also store information about the user, and thus the system can log who enters the building. A security guard with a sign-in sheet would function, but there are many ways to subvert a sign-in sheet, and a guard can be distracted or become inattentive.  This makes smartcard access a better solution. Guards are also more expensive over time.  A camera would record who enters but would not control access. A nonemployee could enter the building. An uncontrolled/supervised sign-in sheet would not be secure."
Objective-2,127,CH2_SEIDL,What concern causes organizations to choose physical locks over electronic locks?  ,,A. They provide greater security.  , B. They are resistant to bypass attempts.  , C. They are harder to pick.  , D. They do not require power. ,D,"Although electronic locks offer a number of advantages, including the ability to provide different codes or access to different users and the ability to deprovision access, they also require power, whether in the form of a battery or constantly provided power from a power source. That means that power loss can cause issues, either due to the lock remaining locked or defaulting to an open state."
Objective-2,128,CH2_SEIDL,Kara has been asked to include IP schema management as part of her configuration management efforts. Which of the following is a security advantage of IP schema configuration management?    ,,A. Detecting rogue devices  , B. Using IP addresses to secure encryption keys  , C. Preventing denial-of-service attacks  , D. Avoiding IP address exhaustion ,A,"Managing her organization’s IP address schema and usage will allow Kara to identify unknown and potentially rogue devices. IP addresses are not used to secure encryption keys, and managing a schema will not help prevent denial-of-service attacks. Keeping track of what IP addresses are in use can help avoid IP address exhaustion, but this does not provide a direct security advantage."
Objective-2,129,CH2_SEIDL,Carole is concerned about security for her server room. She wants the most secure lock she can find for the server room door. Which of the following would be the best choice for her?    ,,A. Combination lock  , B. Key-in-knob  , C. Deadbolt  , D. Padlock ,C,"Of the locks listed here, deadbolts are the most secure. The locking bolt goes into the door frame, making it more secure. Whether a lock uses a key or combination does not change how secure it is. Key-in-knob is a very common, and generally provides less resistance to bypass than a deadbolt-based solution. Finally, padlocks can be cut off with common bolt cutters."
Objective-2,130,CH2_SEIDL,Melissa wants to implement NIC teaming for a server in her datacenter. What two major capabilities will this provide for her?    ,,A. Lower latency and greater throughput  , B. Greater throughput and fault tolerance  , C. Higher latency and fault tolerance  , D. Fault tolerance and lower latency ,B,"NIC teaming can provide greater throughput by sending traffic through multiple network interface cards (NICs) while also ensuring that loss of a card will not cause an outage, thus providing fault tolerance."
Objective-2,131,CH2_SEIDL,Molly is implementing biometrics in her company. Which of the following should be her biggest concern?    ,,A. FAR  , B. FRR  , C. CER  , D. EER ,A,"False acceptance rate (FAR) is the rate at which the system incorrectly allows in someone it should not. This is clearly a significant concern. Any error is a concern, but the false rejection rate is less troublesome than the false acceptance rate. The cross-over error rate (CER) is when the FAR and the false rejection rate (FRR) become equal. This indicates a consistent operation of the biometric system. The equal error rate is another name for crossover error rate."
Objective-2,132,CH2_SEIDL,Mike is concerned about data sovereignty for data that his organization captures and maintains. What best describes his concern? ,,A. Who owns the data that is captured on systems hosted in a cloud provider’s infrastructure?  ," B. Can Mike’s organization make decisions about data that is part of its service, or does it  belong to users? ", C. Is the data located in a country subject to the laws of the country where it is stored?  ," D. Does data have rights on its own, or does the owner of the data determine what rights may apply to it?",C,"Data sovereignty refers to the concept that data that is collected and stored in a country is subject to that country’s laws. This can be a complex issue with multinational cloud services and providers that may store data in multiple countries as part of their normal architecture. It may also create compliance and other challenges based on differences in national laws regarding data, data privacy, and similar issues."
Objective-2,133,CH2_SEIDL,What are the key limiting factors for cryptography on low-power devices? ,,"A. There are system limitations on memory, CPU, and storage.  ", B. The devices cannot support public key encryption due to an inability to factor prime numbers. , C. There is a lack of chipset support for encryption.  , D. Legal limitations for low-power devices prevent encryption from being supported. ,A,"Low-power devices typically have limited processor speed, memory, and storage, meaning that encryption can be a challenge. Fortunately, solutions exist that implement low-power cryptographic processing capabilities, and continued advances in processor design continue to make lower-power processors faster and more efficient. Legal limitations do not typically take into account whether a device is a low-power device, and public key encryption can be implemented on a wide range of CPUs and embedded systems, so factoring prime numbers is unlikely to be an issue."
Objective-2,134,CH2_SEIDL,Fred is responsible for physical security in his company. He wants to find a good way to protect the USB thumb drives that have BitLocker keys stored on them. Which of the following would be the best solution for this situation?    ,,A. Store the drives in a secure cabinet or safe.  , B. Encrypt the thumb drives.  , C. Don’t store BitLocker keys on these drives.  , D. Lock the thumb drives in desk drawers. ,A,"A secure cabinet or safe is tamper-proof and provides a good place to store anything you are trying to physically protect. Encrypting thumb drives would require you to store the key used to encrypt the thumb drive, thus continuing the problem. It is actually a good practice to store BitLocker keys on removable media, provided that media is safeguarded. In most cases, desk drawers are not secure and can easily be broken into, even if they are locked."
Objective-2,135,CH2_SEIDL,Juanita is responsible for servers in her company. She is looking for a fault-tolerant solution that can handle two drives failing. Which of the following should she select?    ,,A. RAID 3  , B. RAID 0  , C. RAID 5  , D. RAID 6 ,D,"RAID 6, disk striping with dual parity, uses a minimum of four disks with distributed parity bits. RAID 6 can handle up to two disks failing. RAID 3 is byte-level striping with dedicated parity and cannot tolerate more than a single drive failing. RAID 0 is disk striping, which cannot handle disk failure, and RAID 5, disk striping with distributed parity, can handle only one disk failing."
Objective-2,136,CH2_SEIDL,"Maria’s organization uses a CCTV monitoring system in their main office building, which is occupied and in use 24-7. The system uses cameras connected to displays to provide real-time monitoring. What additional feature is the most likely to receive requests to ensure that her organization can effectively use the CCTV system to respond to theft a d other issue ?    ",,A. Motion activation  , B. Infrared cameras  , C. DVR  , D. Facial recognition ,C,"The ability to record is not included in many traditional closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring systems and is a key element of investigations of theft and other issues. Motion activation and facial recognition are typically associated with computer-based camera systems but do not directly address the concern Maria is working to handle. Infrared cameras would be more useful in spaces where lights were not always in use, such as outdoors or in facilities that are not occupied at night."
Objective-2,137,CH2_SEIDL,What is the primary threat model against static codes used for multifactor authentication?  ,,A. Brute force  , B. Collisions  , C. Theft  , D. Clock mismatch ,C,"Static codes are typically recorded in a secure location, but if they are not properly secured, or are otherwise exposed, they can be stolen. Brute-force attempts should be detected and prevented by back-off algorithms and other techniques that prevent attacks against multifactor authentication systems. Collisions exist with hashing algorithms, not with static multifactor codes, and clock mismatch issues occur for time-based one-time password (TOTP) codes."
Objective-2,138,CH2_SEIDL,Dennis needs a cryptographic algorithm that provides low latency. What type of cryptosystem is most likely to meet this performance requirement?    ,,A. Hashing  , B. Symmetric encryption  , C. Asymmetric encryption  , D. Electronic one-time pad ,B,"A symmetric cryptosystem will typically perform faster and with less processor overhead and thus lower latency than asymmetric cryptosystems. Hashing is not encryption, and onetime pads are not implemented in modern cryptosystems, although they may have uses in future quantum cryptographic solutions."
Objective-2,139,CH2_SEIDL,The company that Devin works for has selected a nondescript building and does not use exterior signage to advertise that the facility belongs to them. What physical security term describes this type of security control?    ,,A. Industrial camouflage  , B. Demilitarized zone  , C. Industrial obfuscation  , D. Disruptive coloration ,A,"Industrial camouflage efforts minimize how noticeable a facility is, helping it to remain unnoticed by casual observers. Although industrial camouflage can be useful, it is rarely effective against determined adversaries. A demilitarized zone (DMZ) in information security terms is a network segment that is intentionally exposed to the public with appropriate security protecting, while stronger security is applied to nonpublic resources. Disruptive coloration is a camouflage technique but not one used in information security. Industrial obfuscation was made up for this question."
Objective-2,140,CH2_SEIDL,"Ed knows that TLS sessions start using asymmetric encryption, and then move to use symmetric keys. What limitation of asymmetric cryptography drives this design decision?    ",,A. Speed and computational overhead  , B. Key length limitations  , C. Lifespan (time) to brute force it  , D. Key reuse for asymmetric algorithms ,A,"Asymmetric cryptography has a relatively high computational overhead, making symmetric key encryption faster. That means that once you can exchange an ephemeral symmetric key, or a series of keys, you can encrypt and send data more quickly and efficiently using symmetric encryption. There is no key length limitation, and reasonable lifespans are met with either technology. Key reuse is not an issue with a public key encryption scheme."
Objective-2,141,CH2_SEIDL,"When you are concerned about application security, what is the most important issue in memory management?    ",,A. Never allocate a variable any larger than is needed.  , B. Always check bounds on arrays.  ," C. Always declare a variable where you need it (i.e., at function or file level if possible).  ", D. Make sure you release any memory you allocate. ,D,"Failure to release memory you have allocated can lead to a memory leak. Therefore, if you are using a programming language like C++ that allows you to allocate memory, make certain you deallocate that memory as soon as you are finished using it. Allocating only the variable size needed and declaring variables where needed are good programming practices.  However, failure to follow them just leads to wasteful use of memory; it does not lead to a security problem like a memory leak. Although this is a good idea to prevent buffer overflows, it is not a memory management issue."
Objective-2,142,CH2_SEIDL,Bart wants to ensure that the files he encrypts remain secure for as long as possible. What should Bart do to maximize the longevity of his encrypted file’s security?    ,,A. Use a quantum cipher.  , B. Use the longest key possible.  , C. Use an anti-quantum cipher.  , D. Use a rotating symmetric key. ,B,"Using a longer key is the best way to make it less likely that an encrypted file will be cracked. This does not prevent issues with the algorithm itself, but if a vulnerability is not found in an algorithm, adding key length will help ensure that even significant increases in computational power will not result in the encryption being cracked in a reasonable period of time. Quantum computing has the potential to change this, but practical quantum encryption cracking tools are not known to be available yet. There is no such thing as an anti-quantum cipher, and a rotating symmetric key might be used to ensure that a key could not be cracked but does not provide longevity. Instead, it is used to allow ephemeral communications to be less likely to be cracked on an ongoing basis."
Objective-2,143,CH2_SEIDL,"Nadine’s organization stores and uses sensitive information, including Social Security numbers. After a recent compromise, she has been asked to implement technology that can help prevent this sensitive data from leaving the company’s systems and networks. What type of technology should Nadine implement?    ",,A. Stateful firewalls  , B. OEM  , C. DLP  , D. SIEM ,C,"The best answer from this list is DLP, or data loss prevention technology. DLP is designed to protect data from being exposed or leaking from a network using a variety of techniques and technology. Stateful firewalls are used to control which traffic is sent to or from a system, but will not detect sensitive data. OEM is an original equipment manufacturer, and security information and event management (SIEM) can help track events and incidents but will not directly protect data itself."
Objective-2,144,CH2_SEIDL,What form is the data used for quantum key distribution sent in?  ,,A. Bytes  , B. Bits  , C. Qubits  , D. Nuquants ,C,"Encryption keys used for quantum key distribution are sent in the form of qubits. The polarization state of the qubits reflects the bit values of the key. Once sent, the receiver can validate the state of some of those qubits to ensure both sender and receiver have the same key. Bytes and bits are used in traditional data exchanges, and nuquants were made up for this question."
Objective-2,145,CH2_SEIDL,Alicia needs to ensure that a process cannot be subverted by a single employee. What security control can she implement to prevent this?    ,,A. Biometric authentication  , B. Two-person control  , C. Robotic sentries  , D. A DMZ ,B,"Two-person control schemes require two individuals to be involved to perform an action.  This means that Alicia can implement a two-person control scheme knowing that both individuals would have to be involved to subvert the control process. Biometrics will merely validate that a person is who they say they are, robotic sentries do not add any particular value to this scenario, and a demilitarized zone (DMZ) is used to keep front-facing systems in a zone that can be controlled and secured."
Objective-2,146,CH2_SEIDL,"Social login, the ability to use an existing identity from a site like Google, Facebook, or a Microsoft account, is an example of which of the following concepts?     ",,A. Federation  , B. AAA  , C. Privilege creep  , D. Identity and access management ,A,"Social login is an example of a federated approach to using identities. The combination of identity providers and service providers, along with authorization management, is a key part of federation. AAA is authentication, authorization, and accounting and is typically associated with protocols like RADIUS. Privilege creep occurs as staff members change jobs and their privileges are not adjusted to only match their current role. IAM is a broader set of identity and access management practices. Although IAM may be involved in federated identity, this question does not directly describe IAM."
Objective-2,147,CH2_SEIDL,Michelle is traveling and wants to plug her phone into the charger in her hotel room. What security precaution can she use to ensure that her phone is not attacked by a malicious device built into the charger in her room?     ,,A. A USB data blocker  , B. A parallel USB cable  , C. A data circuit breaker  , D. An HOTP interrogator ,A,"USB data blockers are used to ensure that cables can only be used for charging, and not for data transfer. None of the other answers to this question are used for this purpose, and in fact all were made up—USB is a serial bus, circuit breakers are used for power, and HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP) is a type of multifactor token algorithm."
Objective-2,148,CH2_SEIDL,Which cloud service model provides the consumer with the infrastructure to create applications and host them? ,,A. SaaS  , B. PaaS  , C. IaaS  , D. IDaaS ,B,"In the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model, the consumer has access to the infrastructure to create applications and host them. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) supplies a particular application; infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) does not directly provide the ability to create applications, although this distinction is quickly blurring; and IDaaS is identity-as-a-service."
Objective-2,149,CH2_SEIDL,Why is avoiding initialization vector and key reuse recommended to ensure secure encryption?     ,,A. It makes it impossible to brute force.  , B. It means a single successful attack will not expose multiple messages.  , C. It means a single successful attack will not expose any messages.  , D. It makes brute force easier. ,B,"Avoiding reuse of the key components of an encryption process means that even if a malicious actor managed to break the encryption for a message or exchange, the next new initialization vector (IV) and key would require an entirely new brute-force attack. Using a new IV and key does not make brute-force attacks impossible, nor does it make brute force easier. A single successful attack would expose a single message, or however much data was encrypted using that IV and key."
Objective-2,150,CH2_SEIDL,"Dan knows that his Linux system generates entropy that is used for multiple functions, including encryption. Which of the following is a source of entropy for the Linux kernel?     ",,A. Time of day  , B. User login events  , C. Keystrokes and mouse movement  , D. Network packet timing ,C,"The Linux kernel uses user-driven events like keystrokes, mouse movement, and similar events to generate randomness (entropy). The time of day is not random, user logins are typically not frequent enough or random enough to be a useful source of entropy, and network packet timing is not used for this. If you encounter a question like this and don’t know where to start, consider what you know about entropy—it is randomness, so you would be looking for the input that would have the most randomness to it. Thus, you could rule out the time of day, and likely user logins. After that, you might consider what could be controlled by an external party: network packets being sent to the system, and rule that out as a potential attack vector. That leaves keyboard input and mouse movement."
Objective-2,151,CH2_SEIDL,Mike knows that computational overheads are a concern for cryptographic systems. What can he do to help limit the computational needs of his solution?     ,,A. Use hashes instead.  , B. Use short keys.  , C. Use elliptic curve encryption.  , D. Use the RSA algorithm. ,C,"Elliptic curve encryption schemes allow the use of a shorter key for the same strength that an RSA key would require, reducing the computational overhead required to encrypt and decrypt data. That doesn’t mean you should use a short key; instead, you must select a key length that matches your requirements for resistance to brute force and other attacks.  Hashing is nonreversible and is not a form of encryption."
Objective-2,152,CH2_SEIDL,What is the primary role of lighting in a physical security environment? ,,A. It acts as a detective control.  , B. It acts as a reactive control.  , C. It acts as a deterrent control.  , D. It acts as a compensating control. ,C,"Lighting serves a deterrent control, making potential malicious actors feel like they may be observed without dark areas or shadows to hide in. It does not detect actions, it does not compensate for the lack of another control, and although some lights may turn on for motion, the primary purpose is to deter malicious or unwanted actions."
Objective-2,153,CH2_SEIDL,Dennis has deployed servers and storage to each of the facilities his organization runs to ensure that scientific equipment can send and receive data at the speed that it needs to function. What computational design concept describes this?     ,,A. Hybrid cloud  , B. Mist computing  , C. Edge computing  , D. Local cloud ,C,"Edge computing places both data storage and computational power closer to where it is needed to save on bandwidth and to improve the response of associated applications and services. Hybrid computing combines local and cloud computing. Local cloud builds cloud infrastructure on local systems. Mist computing was made up for this question but may sound similar to fog computing, a term that has a similar meaning to edge computing, which uses local computation and storage that is then Internet connected."
Objective-2,154,CH2_SEIDL,Ben replaces sensitive data in his database with unique identifiers. The identifiers allow him to continue to take actions on the data without exposing the data itself. What type of solution has he deployed?     ,,A. Masking  , B. Encryption  , C. Hashing  , D. Tokenization ,D,"Ben has deployed a tokenization scheme. Encryption would require the data to be decrypted to be used, and this is not mentioned. Hashing could be used to conceal values but does not preserve the ability to work with the data. Masking modifies content to conceal personally identifiable information or other sensitive information."
Objective-2,155,CH2_SEIDL,Dana wants to discourage potential malicious actors from accessing her facility. Which of the following is both a deterrent and a physical control?     ,,A. A visitor log  , B. A motion detector  , C. A security camera  , D. Fences ,D,Fencing is both a useful deterrent because it discourages malicious actors from accessing the grounds that Dana wants to protect. It is also an example of a physical control. A visitor log is an administrative control and will not deter malicious actors. Motion detectors and cameras are examples of detective controls.
Objective-2,156,CH2_SEIDL,What additional capabilities does adding a digital signature to an encrypted message provide?     ,,A. Integrity and nonrepudiation  , B. Confidentiality and integrity  , C. Availability and nonrepudiation  , D. Confidentiality and availability ,A,"Adding a digital signature can ensure that both the message has not been changed, and thus its integrity is intact, and that it supports nonrepudiation by proving that the message is from the sender who claims to have sent it."
Objective-2,157,CH2_SEIDL,Megan has been asked to set up a periodic attestation process for accounts in her organization. What has she been asked to do? ,,A. Validate that the users are still employed.  , B. Validate that the user’s rights and permissions are still correct.  , C. Require users to provide proof of identity.  , D. Validate security controls as part of a test. ,B,"Attestation processes request responsible managers or others to validate that user entitlements or privileges are correct and match those that the user should have. Attestation is not an employment verification process, although managers may discover that users who have left the organization still have rights as part of an attestation process. It does not require proof of identity or validation of security controls."
Objective-2,158,CH2_SEIDL,Elaine wants to adopt appropriate response and recovery controls for natural disasters. What type of control should she use to prepare for a multihour power outage caused by a tornado?     ,,A. A hot site  , B. A generator  , C. A PDU  , D. A UPS ,B,"A generator is the most appropriate answer to a multihour outage. Although a hot site would allow her organization to stay online, the cost of a hot site is much higher than that of a generator. A PDU, or power distribution unit, is used to manage and distribute power, not to handle power outages. Finally, UPS systems are not typically designed to handle long outages. Instead, they condition power and ensure that systems remain online long enough for a generator to take over providing power."
Objective-2,159,CH2_SEIDL,What does a message authentication code (MAC) do when used as part of a cryptographic system?     ,,A. It validates the message’s integrity and authenticity.  , B. It validates the message’s confidentiality and authenticity.  , C. It protects the message’s confidentiality and integrity.  , D. None of the above ,A,A MAC supports authentication and integrity and is used to confirm that messages came from the sender who is claimed to have sent it and also ensure that recipients can validate the integrity of the message. It does not help with confidentiality.
Objective-2,160,CH2_SEIDL,Charles wants to put a fire suppression system in place in an area where highly sensitive electronics are in use. What type of fire suppression system is best suited to this type of environment if Charles is concerned about potential harm to first responders or on-site staff?     ,,A. Pre-charge  , B. Dry pipe  , C. Inert gas  , D. Carbon dioxide ,C,"Inert gas systems are used to reduce the oxygen in a room without the hazard to staff that carbon dioxide systems use. Both dry-pipe and pre-charge systems use water, which can harm delicate electronics."
Objective-2,161,CH2_SEIDL,What technology is typically used for proximity card readers? ,,A. Magnetic stripe  , B. Biometrics  , C. RFID  , D. Infrared ,C,Proximity card readers usually work using RFID (radio frequency ID) technology. This allows cards to be used in proximity but without requiring a direct reader like a magnetic stripe. Neither biometrics or infrared are used for proximity card readers.
Objective-2,162,CH2_SEIDL,How does asymmetric encryption support nonrepudiation? ,,A. Using digital signatures  , B. Using longer keys  , C. Using reversible hashes  , D. Using the recipient’s public key ,A,"Digital signatures that use a sender’s private key provide nonrepudiation by allowing a sender to prove that they sent a message. Unless the sender’s private key has been compromised, signing a message with their private key and allowing the recipient to validate the signature using their public key ensures that the sender sent the message in question. Longer keys don’t prove who a sender is, hashes are not reversible, and the public key in use is the sender’s, not the recipient’s."
Objective-2,163,CH2_SEIDL,Olivia knows that she needs to consider geography as part of her security considerations. Which of the following is a primary driver of geographical considerations for security?     ,,A. MTR  , B. Natural disasters  , C. Service integration  , D. Sprawl avoidance ,B,"Natural disasters, as well as man-made disasters, are primary considerations for geographic security considerations. Placing backup sites outside of the likely path or range of a single disaster helps ensure continuity of operations for organizations. MTR is the maximum time to restore, sprawl avoidance is usually considered for virtual machines, and service integration is a consideration for service architectures, not geographical placement."
Objective-2,164,CH2_SEIDL,Scott wants to limit the impact of potential threats from UAVs. What physical security control is best suited to this purpose? ,,A. Adding more fences  , B. Moving sensitive areas to the interior of a building  , C. Deploying biometric sensors  , D. Moving sensitive areas to Faraday cages ,B,"Although actual threats from drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are relatively rare for most organizations, placing sensitive areas further inside a building will deter most current generations of drones from entering or recording them. Security doors and other common obstacles will prevent most UAV or drone penetration that typical organizations will face. Fences are easily bypassed by flying drones, biometric sensors won’t stop a drone from hovering outside of a window, and Faraday cages might stop a drone from receiving commands if you could get the drone inside first!"
Objective-2,165,CH2_SEIDL,Derek wants to explain the concept of resource constraints driving security constraints when using encryption. Which of the following descriptions best explains the trade-offs that he should explain to his management?     ,,"A. Stronger encryption requires more space on drives, meaning that the harder it is to break, the more storage you’ll need, driving up cost. "," B. Stronger encryption is faster, which means that using strong encryption will result in lower latency. ", C. Stronger encryption requires more entropy. This may reduce the overall security of the  system when entropy is exhausted. ," D. Stronger encryption requires more computational resources, requiring a balance between speed and security.",D,"The key trade-off when considering resource constraints for encryption is that stronger encryption with longer keys requires more computational time and resources. This means that it will be slower and will consume more of the capacity of a system. A balance between security and computational overhead needs to be struck that matches the confidentiality needs of the data that is being handled or sent. Stronger encryption is usually slower, running out of entropy in the scenario described is not a typical concern, and stronger encryption taking up significant amounts of drive space is also not a real issue in this scenario."
Objective-2,166,CH2_SEIDL,Amanda wants to ensure that the message she is sending remains confidential. What should she do to ensure this?     ,,A. Hash the messages.  , B. Digitally sign the message.  , C. Encrypt the message.  , D. Use a quantum encryption algorithm. ,C,"Encrypting the message will ensure that it remains confidential as long as only the recipient is able to decrypt it. Hashing the message will result in the message not being recoverable, whereas digitally signing it can provide nonrepudiation. Finally, quantum encryption algorithms and the systems required to use them are not available today, meaning Amanda won’t be able to use them—yet!"
Objective-2,167,CH2_SEIDL,"What security advantage do cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have over local staff and systems for most small to mid-sized organizations?     ",,A. Better understanding of the organization’s business practices  , B. Faster response times  , C. More security staff and budget  , D. None of the above ,C,"In most cases, the major cloud service providers have more security staff and a greater budget for security operations. This means they can invest more in security controls, staffing, monitoring, and other activities. Using a cloud service provider can help improve the overall security posture of an organization that might not have the ability to have full-time or dedicated security staff or expertise. At the same time, local staff will understand the business better and will usually have a faster response time to critical business needs."
Objective-2,168,CH2_SEIDL,"Tim wants to ensure that his web servers can scale horizontally during traffic increases, while also allowing them to be patched or upgraded without causing outages. What type of network device should he deploy?     ",,A. A firewall  , B. A switch  , C. A horizontal scaler  , D. A network load balancer ,D,"Network load balancers distribute traffic among systems, allowing systems to be added or removed, and making patching and upgrades easier by draining connections from systems and removing them from the pool when work needs to be done on them. They can also help monitor systems for performance, report on issues, and ensure that loads match the capabilities of the systems that they are in front of. Firewalls are used for security, switches are a network device used to transfer traffic to the correct system, and a horizontal scaler was made up for this question."
Objective-2,169,CH2_SEIDL,Gabby wants to ensure that sensitive data can be transmitted in unencrypted form by using physical safeguards. What type of solution should she implement?     ,,A. Shielded cables  , B. Armored cables  , C. Distribution lockdown  , D. Protected cable distribution ,D,"Protected cable distribution uses such controls as electrical, electromagnetic, and even acoustic or air pressure sensors to ensure that cables and distribution infrastructure are not accessed, allowing sensitive information to be transmitted in unencrypted form. The U.S.  government identifies three options: hardened carrier, alarmed carrier, and continuously viewed protected distribution systems. Shielded cables are used to prevent EMI."
Objective-2,170,CH2_SEIDL,Maureen conceals information she wants to transmit surreptitiously by modifying an MP3 file in a way that does not noticeably change how it sounds. What is this technique called?     ,,A. MP3crypt  , B. Audio steganography  , C. Audio hashing  , D. Honey MP3s ,B,Maureen is using the concept of audio steganography by hiding data inside an audio file in a way that conceals it from detection. The other options are made up for this question.
Objective-2,171,CH2_SEIDL,Nicole is assessing risks to her multifactor authentication system. Which of the following is the most likely threat model against short message service (SMS) push notifications to cell phones for her environment?     ,,A. Attacks on VoIP systems  , B. SIM cloning  , C. Brute-force attacks  , D. Rainbow tables ,B,"Since Nicole is specifically worried about SMS pushes to cell phones, the most likely attack model is SIM (subscriber identity module) cloning, allowing attackers to obtain the authentication codes sent to legitimate users. Attacks on a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system would typically help intercept SMS if it was sent to VoIP phones, not cell phones (although forwarding is possible, but not mentioned here). Brute-force attacks are unlikely to succeed against SMS phone factors, and rainbow tables are used to crack hashed passwords."
Objective-2,172,CH2_SEIDL,John wants to protect data at rest so that he can process it and use it as needed in its original form. What solution from the following list is best suited to this requirement?     ,,A. Hashing  , B. TLS  , C. Encryption  , D. Tokenization ,C,"Encryption is often used to protect data at rest. When data needs to be accessed, it can be decrypted. Hashing is not reversible, meaning that it is not used for data storage when the original form is needed for processing. Comparing hashed passwords works because the password is presented again, rather than the password needing to be retrieved from storage.  TLS is used to protect data in motion, and tokenization is a data security technique that replaces sensitive data elements with nonsensitive elements that can still be processed in useful ways."
Objective-2,173,CH2_SEIDL,Nathaniel has deployed the control infrastructure for his manufacturing plant without a network connection to his other networks. What term describes this type of configuration? ,,A. DMZ  , B. Air gap  , C. Vaulting  , D. A hot aisle ,B,"Nathaniel has created an air gap, a physical separation that will require manual transport of files, patches, and other data between the two environments. This helps to ensure that attackers cannot access critical systems and that insiders cannot export data from the environment easily. A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a separate network segment or zone that is exposed to the outside world or other lower trust area. A vault is a secured space or room, but vaulting is not a term used on the Security+ exam, and a hot aisle is the aisle where servers exhaust warm air."
Objective-2,174,CH2_SEIDL,Naomi hides the original data in a Social Security number field to ensure that it is not exposed to users of her database. What data security technique does this describe?     ,,A. Masking  , B. Encryption  , C. Hashing  , D. Tokenization ,A,"Masking modifies content to conceal personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive information. Tokenization replaces sensitive information with a nonsensitive alternative that allows the data to still be processed in useful ways. Encryption would require the data to be decrypted to be used, and this is not mentioned. Hashing could be used to conceal values but does not preserve the ability to work with the data."
Objective-2,175,CH2_SEIDL,Isaac wants to use on-premises cloud computing. What term describes this type of cloud computing solution?     ,,A. Infrastructure as a service  , B. Hybrid cloud  , C. Private cloud  , D. Platform as a service ,C,"On-premises cloud computing is often called private cloud. Not all private clouds have to be on-site, because private clouds could be deployed to a remote location like a thirdparty hosting facility. Infrastructure as a service and platform as a service refer to thirdparty hosting services, and hybrid cloud combines both on-premises and cloud computing models."
Objective-2,176,CH2_SEIDL,What is the primary threat model against physical tokens used for multifactor authentication?     ,,A. Cloning  , B. Brute force  , C. Theft  , D. Algorithm failure ,C,"The most likely threat to physical tokens is theft or loss resulting in access to the token.  Cloning tokens might be possible if the token’s seed were known, but they are designed to prevent this from being reverse-engineered, meaning a significant breach of the vendor or similar issue would be required to cause an exposure. Brute force is not a realistic threat against most token implementations, nor is algorithm failure."
Objective-2,177,CH2_SEIDL,"Maria is a security administrator for a large bank. She is concerned about malware, particularly spyware that could compromise customer data. Which of the following would be the best approach for her to mitigate the threat of spyware?     ",,"A. Computer usage policies, network antimalware, and host antimalware  ", B. Host antimalware and network antimalware  ," C. Host and network antimalware, computer usage policies, and website whitelisting  "," D. Host and network antimalware, computer usage policies, and employee training ",D,"Control diversity means utilizing different controls to mitigate the same threat. For malware, the use of technical controls, such as antimalware, is critical. But it is also important to have administrative controls, such as good policies, and to ensure that employees are properly trained. Thus, for this question a combination of policies, training, and tools is the best answer."
Objective-2,178,CH2_SEIDL,Charles has configured his multifactor system to require both a PIN and a password. How many effective factors does he have in place once he presents both of these and his username?     ,,A. One  , B. Two  , C. Three  , D. Four ,A,"Although it may seem like Charles has presented two factors, in fact he has only presented two types of things he knows along with his identity. To truly implement a multifactor environment, he should use more than one of something you have, something you know, and something you are."
Objective-2,179,CH2_SEIDL,Fred adds the value 89EA443CCDA16B89 to every password as a salt. What issue might this cause?     ,,A. The salt is too long.  , B. The salt is alphanumeric.  , C. The salt is reused.  , D. The salt is too short. ,C,"Salt reuse is a critical mistake, because it would allow a rainbow table to be generated using that salt. Although standard rainbow tables would not work, a reused salt would only require the creation of a single new rainbow table. Alphanumeric salts are not a problem, long salts are not a problem, and this salt is a reasonable length at 16 characters using hexadecimal."
Objective-2,180,CH2_SEIDL,Alaina needs to physically secure the root encryption keys for a certificate authority. What type of security device should she use to maintain local control and security for them?     ,,A. A USB thumb drive  , B. A vault or safe  , C. An air-gapped system  , D. None of the above ,B,"Alaina’s need for a local, secure storage area is an ideal situation for the use of a vault or safe where the keys can be stored on a device like a thumb drive. Simply placing them on a drive leaves them vulnerable to theft, and an air-gapped system would also be potentially exposed to theft or local breaches."
Objective-2,181,CH2_SEIDL,Angela wants to help her organization use APIs more securely and needs to select three API security best practices. Which of the following options is not a common API security best practice?     ,,A. Use encryption throughout the API’s request/response cycle.  , B. Authorize before authenticating.  , C. Do not trust input strings and validate parameters.  , D. Enable auditing and logging. ,B,"It is critical to authenticate API users and then to authorize them to take actions. If you authorized first and then authenticated, users could take action before you knew who they were! Encrypting throughout the use of the API keeps data and queries secure, validating input and filtering out dangerous strings is important to prevent injection and other attacks, and auditing and logging allows you to troubleshoot and respond to issues and attacks."
Objective-2,182,CH2_SEIDL,Frank uses a powerful magnet to wipe tapes before they are removed from his organization’s inventory. What type of secure data destruction technique has he used? ,,A. Tape burning  , B. Data shredding  , C. Degaussing  , D. Pulping ,C,Frank has used a degausser to erase the data on the tapes. Degaussing only works on magnetic media like tapes and will not work on optical or flash media. Burning media or materials is exactly what it sounds like—putting them into a fire! Shredding and pulping are mechanical means of destruction.
Objective-2,183,CH2_SEIDL,Angela has been asked to deploy 5G cellular inside her organization. What concern should she raise with her management about the effort to implement it?     ,,A. 5G requires high levels of antenna density for full coverage.  , B. 5G signals should only be used in exterior deployments.  , C. 5G is not widely available and cannot be deployed yet.  , D. 5G signals cannot coexist with traditional Wi-Fi. ,A,"5G requires higher antenna density for full bandwidth communication than previous technologies, meaning that Angela’s organization will have to carefully consider antenna placement, particularly inside buildings where structural elements can create challenges with signal propagation. 5G is usable indoors, is commercially available, and can coexist with traditional Wi-Fi, so Angela should not include those in her list of concerns."
Objective-2,184,CH2_SEIDL,Chris is reviewing the rights that staff in his organization have to data stored in a group of departmental file shares. He is concerned that rights management practices have not been followed and that employees who have been with the company he works for have not had their privileges removed after they switched jobs. What type of issue has Chris encountere ?     ,,A. Privilege creep  , B. IAM inflation  , C. Masking issues  , D. Privilege escalation ,A,"Chris is concerned about privilege creep, the slow accumulation of privileges over time as staff members change roles and their privileges are not removed or updated. Privilege management processes would help to prevent this, thus keeping data more secure. Of the other options, only privilege escalation is a common term, and it means gaining additional privileges, typically as part of an attack from an account with fewer privileges to a more privileged account like an administrator or root account."
Objective-2,185,CH2_SEIDL,Isaac has been asked to set up a honeyfile. What should he configur ? ,,A. A list of tasks to accomplish  , B. A list of potentially valuable data  , C. A bait file for attackers to access  , D. A vulnerable Word file ,C,Honeyfiles are files that are intended to help detect attackers. They are placed in a location where accessing them can be detected but are not set up to allow users to access them.  That means that attackers who access the seemingly desirable file can be easily detected and appropriate alerts can be sent.
Objective-2,186,CH2_SEIDL,Yasmine wants to ensure that she has met a geographic dispersal requirement for her datacenters. How far away should she place her datacenter based on common best practices for dispersal? ,,A. 5 miles  , B. 45 miles  , C. 90 miles  , D. 150 miles ,C,"Although there is no specific recommended distance, recommendations typically range from 60 to 120 miles away to ensure that a single disaster is unlikely to disable both locations."
Objective-2,187,CH2_SEIDL,What term describes extending cloud computing to the edge of an enterprise network? ,,A. Local cloud  , B. Fog computing  , C. Managed cloud  , D. Blade computing ,B,"Fog computing is a term coined by Cisco to describe cloud computing at the edge of an enterprise network. The more common term for this is edge computing, but you may encounter both terms. Fog implementations handle significant amounts of computation, communication, and storage activities locally, while also connecting to cloud services to perform some of the work."
Objective-2,188,CH2_SEIDL,Which of the following algorithms is a key stretching algorithm? ,,A. bcrypt  , B. ncrypt  , C. MD5  , D. SHA1 ,A,"Bcrypt, scrypt, and PBKDF2 are all examples of key stretching algorithms. MD5 and SHA1 are both hashing algorithms, and ncrypt was made up for this question."
Objective-2,189,CH2_SEIDL,Jocelyn has been asked to implement a directory service. Which of the following technologies should she deploy?  ,,A. SAML  , B. OAuth  , C. LDAP  , D. 802.1x ,C,"The only directory service listed is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  SAML is Security Assertion Markup Language, OAuth is an authorization delegation protocol, and 802.1x is a network authentication protocol."
