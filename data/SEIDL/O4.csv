Objective-4,1,CH4_SEIDL,"Mila wants to generate a unique digital fingerprint for a file, and needs to choose between a checksum and a hash. Which option should she choose and why should she choose it? ",,"A. A hash, because it is unique to the file  "," B. A checksum, because it verifies the contents of the file  "," C. A hash, because it can be reversed to validate the file "," D. A checksum, because it is less prone to collisions than a hash  ",A,"Mila should select a hash because a hash is designed to be unique to each possible input.  That means that multiple files could have the same checksum value, whereas a hashing algorithm will be unique for each file that it is run against."
Objective-4,2,CH4_SEIDL,Which of the following would prevent a user from installing a program on a company-owned mobile device?,,A. An allow list , B. A deny list  , C. ACL , D. HIDS    ,A,"Allow lists are lists of approved software. Software can only be installed if it is on an allow list. Deny lists block specific applications, but they cannot account for every possible malicious application. Access control lists (ACLs) determine who can access a resource.  A host intrusion detection system (HIDS) does not prevent software from being installed."
Objective-4,3,CH4_SEIDL,Liam is responsible for monitoring security events in his company. He wants to see how diverse events may connect using his security information and event management (SIEM).  He is interested in identifying different indicators of compromise that may point to the same breach. Which of the following would be most helpful for him to implement? ,,A. NIDS , B. PKI  , C. A correlation dashboard , D. A trend dashboard    ,C,"Correlation dashboards are used to aggregate events and to seek out connections. In some cases, this is done with advanced analytic algorithms, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) would be helpful but will not (by itself) necessarily correlate events. A public key infrastructure (PKI) handles certificates, not correlation and visibility of security events. Trend dashboards would show how things are going and which way statistics and information are moving."
Objective-4,4,CH4_SEIDL,"Emily wants to capture HTTPS packets using tcpdump. If the service is running on its default port and her Ethernet adapter is eth0, which tcpdump command should she use? ",,A. tcpdump eth0 -proto https , B. tcpdump -i eth0 -proto https  , C. tcpdump tcp https eth0 , D. tcpdump -i eth0 tcp port 443    ,D,"Using tcpdump with flags like -i to set the interface, tcp to set the protocol, and port to set the port will capture exactly the traffic Emily needs to capture. Port 443 is the default HTTPS port. There is no -proto flag for tcpdump."
Objective-4,5,CH4_SEIDL,"Mila gives her team a scenario, and then asks them questions about how they would respond, what issues they expect they might encounter, and how they would handle those issues. What type of exercise has she conducted? ",,A. A tabletop exercise , B. A walk-through  , C. A simulation , D. A drill    ,A,"Tabletop exercises are used to talk through a process. Unlike walk-throughs, which focus on step-by-step review of an incident, Mila will focus more on how her team responds and on learning from those answers. A tabletop exercise can involve gaming out a situation. A simulation actually emulates an event or incident, either on a small or a large scale. Drills are not defined as part of the Security+ exam outline."
Objective-4,6,CH4_SEIDL,Murali is preparing to acquire data from various devices and systems that are targets in a forensic investigation. Which of the following devices is the least volatile according to the order of volatility? ,,A. Backups , B. CPU cache  , C. Local disk , D. RAM    ,A,"Backups are considered to be the least volatile type of storage since they change at a much slower pace and, in fact, may be intentionally retained for long periods of time without changing. In this list, CPU cache will change the most frequently, then RAM, then local disk contents."
Objective-4,7,CH4_SEIDL,Henry has been asked for vulnerability scan results by an incident responder. He is curious to know why the responder needs scan results. What answer would you provide to him to explain why scan results are needed and are useful?,,A. The scans will show the programs the attackers used. , B. The scans will show the versions of software installed before the attack.  , C. Vulnerable services will provide clues about what the attackers may have targeted. , D. The scans will show where firewalls and other network devices were in place to help with incident analysis.     ,C,"Incident responders know that scan results can show vulnerable systems and services, providing clues about how attackers may have obtained access to systems. The scans will not show the programs the attackers used but may show services that they have enabled or changed. The scans will show the versions of software installed before the attack, but that information is only useful if the attackers either upgraded or changed the software or the software was vulnerable, making this a less accurate and useful answer. Finally, the scans may show where network security devices are, but that information should be available to the incident response team without trying to figure it out from scans."
Objective-4,8,CH4_SEIDL,What phase of the incident response process should be placed at point A in the following image? Lessons Learned A Incident Response Process Eradication 9. Preparation Identification Containment,,A. Simulations , B. Review  , C. Recovery , D. Patching    ,C,"After eradication of the issue has been completed, recovery can begin. Recovery can include restoration of services and a return to normal operations."
Objective-4,9,CH4_SEIDL,Nick is reviewing commands run on a Windows 10 system and discovers that the route command was run with the -p flag. What occurred?  ,,A. Routes were discovered using a ping command. , B. The route’s path will be displayed. , C. A route was added that will persist between boots. , D. A route was added that will use the path listed in the command.    ,C,"The -p flag adds a persistent route when combined with the ADD command. Persistent routes will remain in the routing table between boots. By default, they are cleared at each boot. An attacker may choose to use this to help with an on-path (man-in-the-middle) attack."
Objective-4,10,CH4_SEIDL,Lucca wants to acquire open source intelligence information using an automated tool that can leverage search engines and tools like Shodan. Which of the following tools should he select?,,A. curl , B. hping , C. netcat , D. theHarvester    ,D,"Of the options provided, only theHarvester is an open source intelligence tool. Curl is a tool used to transfer data, hping is a tool that is frequently used to build custom packets and to perform packet analyzer functions, and netcat is a utility that allows you to read and write to network connections, making it a broadly used tool for pen testers and attackers who need to transfer data using a small, capable utility."
Objective-4,11,CH4_SEIDL,Brent wants to use a tool to help him analyze malware and attacks and wants to cover a broad range of tactics and tools that are used by adversaries. Which of the following is broadly implemented in technical tools and covers techniques and tactics without requiring a specific order of operations?,,A. The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis , B. The Cyber Kill Chain , C. The MITRE ATT&CK framework , D. The CVSS standard    ,C,The MITRE ATT&CK framework focuses on techniques and tactics and does not focus on a specific order of operations like the Cyber Kill Chain does. It also covers a broader range of techniques and adversaries than the Diamond Model does and is broadly implemented in many existing tools. The CVSS standard is a vulnerability scoring system and is not a useful framework for analyzing malware and attacks.
Objective-4,12,CH4_SEIDL,Ted needs to preserve a server for forensic purposes. Which of the following should he not do?,,A. Turn the system off to ensure that data does not change. , B. Remove the drive while the system is running to ensure that data does not change. , C. Leave the machine connected to the network so that users can continue to use it. , D. All of the above    ,D,"To properly preserve the system, Ted needs to ensure that it does not change. Turning the system off will cause anything in memory to be lost, which may be needed for the investigation. Removing the drive while a system is running can cause data to be lost. Instead, live imaging the machine and its memory may be required. Allowing users to continue to use a machine will result in changes, which can also damage Ted’s ability to perform a forensic investigation."
Objective-4,13,CH4_SEIDL,What mitigation technique is used to limit the ability of an attack to continue while keeping systems and services online? ,,A. Segmentation , B. Isolation , C. Nuking , D. Containment    ,D,"Containment efforts are used to limit the spread or impact of an incident. Containment may focus on keeping systems or services online to ensure that organizations can continue to function until other options for business continuity can be implemented. Segmentation moves systems or services into different security zones, and isolation removes them from all contact or puts them in small groups that are removed from the rest of the organization and systems that are not impacted."
Objective-4,14,CH4_SEIDL,Jessica wants to review the network traffic that her Windows system has sent to determine if a file containing sensitive data was uploaded from the system. What Windows log file can she use to find this information? ,,A. The application log , B. The network log , C. The security log , D. None of the above    ,D,"Windows does not log network traffic at a level of granularity that will show if a file has been uploaded. Basic traffic statistics can be captured, but without additional sensors and information gathering capabilities, Jessica will not be able to determine if files are sent from a Windows system."
Objective-4,15,CH4_SEIDL,"What term is used to describe the documentation trail for control, analysis, transfer, and final disposition of evidence for digital forensic work? ",,A. Evidence log , B. Paper trail , C. Chain of custody , D. Digital footprint    ,C,"The chain of custody in forensic activities tracks who has a device, data, or other forensic artifact at any time, when transfers occur, who performed analysis, and where the item, system, or device goes when the forensic process is done. Evidence logs may be maintained by law enforcement to track evidence that is gathered. Paper trail and digital footprint are not technical terms used for digital forensics."
Objective-4,16,CH4_SEIDL,"Henry wants to determine what services are on a network that he is assessing. Which of the following tools will provide him with a list of services, ports, and their status?",,A. nmap , B. route , C. hping , D. netstat    ,A,"Of the listed tools, only nmap is a port scanner, and thus it is the tool that will provide the required information. route is a command-line tool to view and add network traffic routes.  hping is a packet generator and analyzer, and netstat is a command-line tool that shows network connections, interface statistics, and other useful information about a system’s network usage."
Objective-4,17,CH4_SEIDL,"Nathan needs to know how many times an event occurred and wants to check a log file for that event. Which of the following grep commands will tell him how many times the event happened if each occurrence is logged independently in the logfile.txt log file, and uses a unique event ID: event101?",,A. grep logfile.txt -n 'event101' , B. grep -c 'event101' logfile.txt , C. grep logfile.txt -c 'event101' , D. grep -c event101 -i logfile.txt    ,B,"The -c flag for grep counts the number of occurrences for a given string in a file. The -n flag shows the matched lines and line numbers. Even if you’re not sure about which flag is which, the syntax should help on a question like this. When using grep, the pattern comes before the filename, allowing you to rule out two of the options right away."
Objective-4,18,CH4_SEIDL,Jacob wants to ensure that all of the areas that are impacted by an incident are addressed by his incident response team. What term is used to describe the relationship and communications process that teams use to ensure that all of those involved are treated appropriately? ,,A. COOP , B. Stakeholder management , C. PAM , D. Communications planning    ,B,"Stakeholder management involves working with stakeholders, or those who have an interest in the event or impacted systems or services. COOP, or Continuity of Operations Planning, is a U.S. federal government effort to ensure that federal agencies have continuity plans. PAM is privileged account management. Stakeholder management involves more than just communications, although communications is an important part of it."
Objective-4,19,CH4_SEIDL,"While Susan is conducting a forensic review of logs from two servers hosted in the same datacenter, she notices that log items on the first server occurred exactly an hour before matching events on the second server. What is the most likely cause of such exact occurrences?",,"A. The attack took an hour to complete, providing the attacker with access to the second machine an hour later. "," B. The log entries are incorrect, causing the events to appear at the wrong time. ", C. The attacker used a script causing events to happen exactly an hour apart. , D. A time offset is causing the events to appear to occur at different times.    ,D,The most common reason for a one-hour time offset between two systems in the same location is a faulty time zone setting creating a time offset between the systems.
Objective-4,20,CH4_SEIDL,What is the primary usage of Domain Name System (DNS) data in incident investigations and operational security monitoring? ,,A. DNS data is used to capture network scans. , B. DNS data can be used to identify domain transfer attacks. , C. DNS log information can be used to identify malware going to known malicious sites. , D. DNS log information can be used to identify unauthorized logins.    ,C,"DNS data is frequently logged to help identify compromised systems or systems that have visited known phishing sites. DNS logs can be used along with IP reputation and known bad hostname lists to identify issues like these. DNS data is not commonly used to identify network scans and cannot capture them. Domain transfers are not attacks, although they are information gathering and will show in the logs. DNS does not capture information about logins."
Objective-4,21,CH4_SEIDL,Dani generates an OpenSSL certificate using the following command. What has she set with the flag -rsa:2048? openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privateKey.key -out mycert.crt,,A. The year that the certificate will expire , B. The key length in bytes , C. The year that the root certificate will expire , D. The key length in bits    ,D,"Even if you’re not deeply familiar with the openssl command-line utility, you should know that certificates use ciphers that accept a bit length as a flag and that bit lengths like 1024, 2048, and 4096 are common. These key lengths are not commonly communicated in bytes, and certificates are unlikely to last for multiple decades, although a certificate authority (CA) root certificate can last for a long time."
Objective-4,22,CH4_SEIDL,Theresa wants to view the last 10 lines of a log file and to see it change as modifications are made. What command should she run on the Linux system she is logged in to?  ,,A. head -f -end 10 logfile.log , B. tail -f logfile.log , C. foot -watch -l 10 logfile.log , D. follow -tail 10 logfile.log    ,B,"By default, the tail command shows the last 10 lines of a file, and using the -f flag follows changes in the file. head shows the top of a file, and foot and follow were made up for this question."
Objective-4,23,CH4_SEIDL,Henry wants to acquire the firmware from a running system. What is the most likely technique that he will need to use to acquire the firmware?,,A. Connect using a serial cable. , B. Acquire the firmware from memory using memory forensics tools. , C. Acquire the firmware from disk using disk forensic tools. , D. None of the above    ,B,"Although firmware acquisition is a less commonly used technique, firmware is typically stored in a chip on a system board rather than on disk. Henry is most likely to succeed if he retrieves the running firmware from memory. A serial connection may work but would typically require rebooting the system."
Objective-4,24,CH4_SEIDL,Eric wants to determine how much bandwidth was used during a compromise and where the traffic was directed to. What technology can he implement before the event to help him see this detail and allow him to have an effective bandwidth monitoring solution? ,,A. A firewall , B. NetFlow , C. packetflow , D. A DLP    ,B,"Network flows using NetFlow or sFlow would provide the information that Eric wants, with details of how much traffic was used, when, and where traffic was directed. A firewall or data loss prevention (DLP) would not show the bandwidth detail, although a firewall may show the connection information for events. Packetflow was made up for this question and is not a technology used for this purpose."
Objective-4,25,CH4_SEIDL,Naomi has acquired an image of a drive as part of a forensic process. She wants to ensure that the drive image matches the original. What should she create and record to validate this? ,,A. A third image to compare to the original and new image , B. A directory listing to show that the directories match , C. A photographic image of the two drives to show that they match , D. A hash of the drives to show that their hashes match    ,D,"Hashing using MD5 or SHA1 is commonly used to validate that a forensic image matches the original drive. Many forensic duplicators automatically generate a hash of both drives when they complete the imaging process to ensure that there is a documentation chain for the forensic artifacts. A third image may be useful but does not validate this. Directory listings do not prove that drives match, and photos, though useful to document the drives and serial numbers, do not validate the contents of the drives."
Objective-4,26,CH4_SEIDL,Ryan has been asked to run Nessus on his network. What type of tool has he been asked to run?,,A. A fuzzer , B. A vulnerability scanner , C. A WAF , D. A protocol analyzer    ,B,"Nessus is a popular vulnerability scanning tool. It is not a fuzzer, web application firewall (WAF), or protocol analyzer."
Objective-4,27,CH4_SEIDL,Jason wants to ensure that the digital evidence he is collecting during his forensic investigation is admissible. Which of the following is a common requirement for admissibility of evidence? ,,A. It must be relevant. , B. It must be hearsay. , C. It must be timely. , D. It must be public.    ,A,"Of the options listed, the only requirement for admissibility is that the evidence must be relevant. Evidence must also be authenticated, meaning that it needs to be genuine."
Objective-4,28,CH4_SEIDL,Which of the following key elements is not typically included in the design of a communication plan?,,A. Incident severity , B. Customer impact , C. Employee impact , D. Cost to the organization    ,D,"The cost to the organization is not typically a part of communications planning. Since incidents can have a broad range of costs, and since exposing those costs can cause worry or a loss of customer confidence in the worst case, the costs of the incident are relatively rarely exposed as part of the incident response process. Communications with customers and employees is critical, and having different communication plans for different event severities helps ensure that appropriate communications occur."
Objective-4,29,CH4_SEIDL,Rick runs the following command: cat file1.txt file2.txt What will occur? ,,A. The contents of file1.txt will be appended to file2.txt. ," B. The contents of file1.txt will be displayed, and then the contents of file2 will be displayed. ", C. The contents of file2.txt will be appended to file1.txt. , D. The contents of both files will be combined line by line.    ,B,"The cat command without an angle bracket to redirect it will simply display the contents of the files listed. Thus, this command will display file1.txt, and then file2.txt.  If Rick had inserted > between the two files, it would have appended file1.txt to file2.txt."
Objective-4,30,CH4_SEIDL,Michelle wants to check for authentication failures on a CentOS Linux–based system. Where should she look for these event logs? ,,A. /var/log/auth.log , B. /var/log/fail , C. /var/log/events , D. /var/log/secure    ,D,"CentOS and Red Hat both store authentication log information in /var/log/secure instead of /var/log/auth.log used by Debian and Ubuntu systems. Knowing the differences between the major distributions can help speed up your forensic and incident investigations, and consistency is one of the reasons that organizations often select a single Linux distribution for their infrastructure whenever it is possible to do so."
Objective-4,31,CH4_SEIDL,A web page’s title is considered what type of information about the page?,,A. Summary , B. Metadata , C. Header data , D. Hidden data    ,B,"Web page titles, as well as headers like meta tags, are examples of metadata about a page and are frequently used to gather information about web pages and websites. Headers are used as part of a page’s design and typically describe the bar at the top of the page used for site navigation. Summary and hidden data are not technical terms used to describe web page components."
Objective-4,32,CH4_SEIDL,Nelson has discovered malware on one of the systems he is responsible for and wants to test it in a safe environment. Which of the following tools is best suited to that testing?,,A. strings , B. scanless , C. Cuckoo , D. Sn1per    ,C,"Cuckoo, or Cuckoo Sandbox, is a malware analysis sandbox that will safely run malware and then analyze and report on its behavior. strings is a command-line tool that retrieves strings from binary data. scanless is a tool described as a port scraper, which retrieves port information without running a port scan by using websites and services to run the scan for you. Sn1per is a pen test framework."
Objective-4,33,CH4_SEIDL,Lucca wants to view metadata for a file so that he can determine the author of the file. What tool should he use from the following list? ,,A. Autopsy , B. strings , C. exiftool , D. grep    ,C,"Although Autopsy, strings, and grep can all be used to retrieve information from files, exiftool is the only purpose-built file metadata retrieval tool listed."
Objective-4,34,CH4_SEIDL,Isaac wants to acquire an image of a system that includes the operating system. What tool can he use on a Windows system that can also capture live memory?,,A. dd , B. FTK Imager , C. Autopsy , D. WinDump    ,B,"FTK Imager is a free tool that can image both systems and memory, allowing Isaac to capture the information he wants. Although dd is useful for capturing disks, other tools are typically used for memory dumps, and though dd can be used on a Windows system, FTK Imager is a more likely choice. Autopsy is a forensic analysis tool and does not provide its own imaging tools. WinDump is a Windows version of tcpdump, a protocol analyzer."
Objective-4,35,CH4_SEIDL,Jason is conducting a forensic investigation and has retrieved artifacts in addition to drives and files. What should he do to document the artifacts he has acquired?  ,,A. Image them using dd and ensure that a valid MD5sum is generated. ," B. Take a picture of them, label them, and add them to the chain of custody documentation. ", C. Contact law enforcement to properly handle the artifacts. , D. Engage legal counsel to advise him how to handle artifacts in an investigation.    ,B,"When artifacts are acquired as part of an investigation, they should be logged and documented as part of the evidence related to the investigation. Artifacts could include a piece of paper with passwords on it, tools or technology related to an exploit or attack, smartcards, or any other element of an investigation."
Objective-4,36,CH4_SEIDL,Gary wants to check for the mail servers for example.com. What tool and command can he use to determine this?  ,,A. nslookup -query =mx example.com , B. ping -email example.com , C. smtp -mx example.com , D. email -lookup -mx example.com    ,A,"The MX records for a domain list its email servers. Gary can use nslookup to query Domain Name System (DNS) for the MX servers using the command nslookup -query =mx example.com to look up example.com’s email server. ping does not support MX server lookups, and both smtp and email are not commandline tools."
Objective-4,37,CH4_SEIDL,Which of the following is best suited to analyzing live SIP traffic?  ,,A. Log files , B. Wireshark , C. Nessus , D. SIPper    ,B,"Wireshark can be used to capture and analyze live Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) traffic on a network. Analysts should keep the fact that SIP traffic may be encrypted on their network and that they may need to take additional steps to fully view the content of SIP packets.  Log files can provide information about SIP sessions and events and are useful for analysis after the fact, but they won’t provide the same detail about live SIP traffic. Nessus is a vulnerability scanner, and SIPper was made up for this question."
Objective-4,38,CH4_SEIDL,Andrea wants to identify services on a remote machine and wants the services to be labeled with service names and other common details. Which of the following tools will not provide that information? ,,A. netcat , B. Sn1per , C. Nessus , D. nmap    ,A,"Although all of the tools listed can perform a port scan and identify open ports, netcat is the only one that does not also integrate automated service identification."
Objective-4,39,CH4_SEIDL,Joseph is writing a forensic report and wants to be sure he includes appropriate detail. Which of the following would not typically be included while discussing analysis of a system?  ,,A. Validation of the system clock’s time settings , B. The operating system in use , C. The methods used to create the image , D. A picture of the person from whom the system was taken    ,D,Forensic reports should include appropriate technical detail. Analysis of a system does not include a picture of the person from whom the system was acquired.
Objective-4,40,CH4_SEIDL,Greg believes an attacker has been using a brute-force password attack against a Linux system he is responsible for. What command could he use to determine if this is the case?  ,,"A. grep ""Failed password"" /var/log/auth.log ", B. tail /etc/bruteforce.log , C. head /etc/bruteforce.log ," D. grep ""Failed login"" /etc/log/auth.log    ",A,"This question tests your knowledge of both the common Linux logs and basic format information for the auth.log file. Greg could use grep to search for ""Failed password"" in the auth.log file found in /var/log on many Linux systems.  There is not a common log file named bruteforce.log; tail and head are not useful for searching through the file, only for showing a set number of lines; and /etc/ is not the normal location for the auth.log file."
Objective-4,41,CH4_SEIDL,Elaine wants to determine what websites a user has recently visited using the contents of a forensically acquired hard drive. Which of the following locations would not be useful for her investigation?  ,,A. The browser cache , B. The browser history , C. The browser’s bookmarks , D. Session data    ,C,"The browser cache, history, and session information will all contain information from recently visited sites. Bookmarks may indicate sites that a user has visited at some point, but a bookmark can be added without visiting a site at all."
Objective-4,42,CH4_SEIDL,Jason wants to acquire network forensic data. What tool should he use to gather this information?  ,,A. nmap , B. Nessus , C. Wireshark , D. SNMP    ,C,"Wireshark is a packet analyzer that can be used to capture and analyze network traffic for forensic purposes. Unlike disk forensics, network forensics require forethought and intentional capture of data before it is needed since traffic is ephemeral. Organizations that want to have a view of network traffic without capturing all traffic might use NetFlow or sFlow to provide some information about network traffic patterns and usage. Nessus is a vulnerability scanner, nmap is a port scanner, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol used to transfer and gather information about network devices and status."
Objective-4,43,CH4_SEIDL,Ananth has been told that attackers sometimes use ping to map networks. What information returned by ping could be most effectively used to determine network topology?  ,,A. TTL , B. Packets sent , C. Packets received , D. Transit time    ,A,"Mapping networks using ping relies on pinging each host, and then uses time-to-live (TTL) information to determine how many hops exist between known hosts and devices inside a network. When TTLs decrease, another router or switch typically exists between you and the device. Packets sent and received can be used to determine if there are issues with the path or link, and transit time can provide information about relative network distance or the path used, but traceroute provides far more useful detail in that case."
Objective-4,44,CH4_SEIDL,Susan has discovered evidence of a compromise that occurred approximately five months ago. She wants to conduct an incident investigation but is concerned about whether the data will exist. What policy guides how long logs and other data are kept in most organizations? ,,A. The organization’s data classification policy , B. The organization’s backup policy , C. The organization’s retention policy , D. The organization’s legal hold policy    ,C,"Organizations define retention policies for different data types and systems. Many organizations use 30-, 45-, 90-, 180-, or 365-day retention policies, with some information required to be kept longer due to law or compliance reasons. Susan’s organization may keep logs for as little as 30 days depending on storage limitations and business needs. Data classification policies typically impact how data is secured and handled. Backup policies determine how long backups are retained and rotated and may have an impact on data if the logs are backed up, but backing up logs are a less common practice due to the space they take up versus the value of having logs backed up. Legal hold practices are common, but policies are less typically defined for legal holds since requirements are set by law."
Objective-4,45,CH4_SEIDL,Selah executes the following command on a system. What has she accomplished?  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=4096  ,,A. Copying the disk /dev/zero to the disk /dev/sda , B. Formatting /dev/sda , C. Writing zeroes to all of /dev/sda , D. Cloning /dev/sda1    ,C,"Zero-wiping a drive can be accomplished using dd, and when this command is completed Selah will have written zeroes to the entire drive /dev/sda."
Objective-4,46,CH4_SEIDL,Jim is preparing a presentation about his organization’s incident response process and wants to explain why communications with involved groups and individuals across the organization are important. Which of the following is the primary reason that organizations communicate with and involve staff from affected areas throughout the organization in incident response efforts? ,,A. Legal compliance , B. Retention policies , C. Stakeholder management , D. A COOP    ,C,"Involving impacted areas, or those that have a role in the process, is part of stakeholder management and ensures that those who need to be involved or aware of the incident response process are engaged throughout the process. Laws rarely have specific requirements for internal involvement, instead focusing on customers or those whose data is involved in an incident. Retention policies determine what data is kept and for how long. COOP is Continuity of Operations Planning, a federal effort to ensure disaster recovery and business continuity plans are in place for federal agencies."
Objective-4,47,CH4_SEIDL,Elle is conducting an exercise for her organization and wants to run an exercise that is as close to an actual event as possible. What type of event should she run to help her organization get this type of real-world practice?  ,,A. A simulation , B. A tabletop exercise , C. A walk-through , D. A wargame    ,A,"A simulation is the closest you can get to a real-world event without having one. A tabletop exercise has personnel discussing scenarios, whereas a walk-through goes through checklists and procedures. A wargame is not a common exercise type."
Objective-4,48,CH4_SEIDL,Erin wants to determine what devices are on a network but cannot use a port scanner or vulnerability scanner. Which of the following techniques will provide the most data about the systems that are active on the network?  ,,A. Run Wireshark in promiscuous mode. , B. Query DNS for all A records in the domain. , C. Review the CAM tables for all the switches in the network. , D. Run netstat on a local workstation.    ,C,"The Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) tables on switches contain a list of all the devices they have talked to and will give Erin the best chance of identifying the devices on the network. Wireshark and netstat will only have a view of the devices that the system she is working from communicate with or that broadcast on the network segment she is on.  Domain Name System (DNS) will list only systems that have a DNS entry. In most organizations, relatively few systems will have entries in DNS."

Purge , B. Deep-freeze , C. Quarantine , D. Retention    ,C,"A quarantine process or setting will preserve malicious or dangerous files and programs without allowing them to run. This allows defenders to retrieve them for further analysis as well as to return them to use if they are determined not to be malicious, or if the malicious components can be removed from needed files. Purging, deep-freezing, and retention are not terms used to describe this behavior or setting."
Objective-4,51,CH4_SEIDL,"A senior vice president in the organization that Chuck works in recently lost a phone that contained sensitive business plans and information about suppliers, designs, and other important materials. After interviewing the vice president, Chuck finds out that the phone did not have a passcode set and was not encrypted, and that it could not be remotely wiped. What type of control should Chuck recommend for his company to help prevent future issues like this?  ",,A. Use containment techniques on the impacted phones. , B. Deploy a DLP system. , C. Deploy an MDM system. , D. Isolate the impacted phones.    ,C,"Chuck should recommend a mobile device management (MDM) system to ensure that organizational devices can be managed and protected in the future. Data loss prevention (DLP) will not stop a lost phone from being a potential leak of data, isolating the phones is not a realistic scenario for devices that will actually be used, nor is containment because the phone is out of the organization’s control once lost."
Objective-4,52,CH4_SEIDL,The school that Gabby works for wants to prevent students from browsing websites that are not related to school work. What type of solution is best suited to help prevent this?  ,,A. A content filter , B. A DLP , C. A firewall , D. An IDS    ,A,"A content filter is specifically designed to allow organizations to select both specific sites and categories of content that should be blocked. Gabby could review content categories and configure the filter to prevent students from browsing to the unwanted sites. A data loss prevention (DLP) solution is designed to prevent data loss, a firewall can block IP addresses or hostnames but would require additional functionality to filter content, and an intrusion detection system (IDS) can detect unwanted traffic but cannot stop it."
Objective-4,53,CH4_SEIDL,"Frank knows that forensic information he is interested in is stored on a system’s hard drive. If he wants to follow the order of volatility, which of the following items should be forensically captured after the hard drive?  ",,A. Caches and registers , B. Backups , C. Virtual memory , D. RAM    ,B,"Information stored on a disk drive is one of the least volatile items in the order of volatility, but backups are even less volatile. That means Frank should capture backups after he images the disk drive and that he should capture CPU cache and registers as well as system RAM first if he needs them."
Objective-4,54,CH4_SEIDL,Greg runs the following command. What occurs?  chmod -R 755 /home/greg/files  ,,"A. All of the files in /home/greg/ are set to allow the group to read, write, and execute them, and Greg and the world can only read them. "," B. The read, write, and execute permissions will be removed from all files in the /home/ greg/files directory. "," C. All of the files in /home/greg/files are set to allow Greg to read, write, and execute them, and the group and the world can only read them. "," D. A new directory will be created with read, write, and execute permissions for the world and read-only permissions for Greg and the group he is in.    ",C,"The -R flag applies the permission recursively to all files in the named directory. Here, the permissions are 7, which sets the owner to read, write, and execute, and 55, which sets group and then world permissions to read only. 755 is a very commonly used permission on Linux systems."
Objective-4,55,CH4_SEIDL,Charles wants to ensure that the forensic work that he is doing cannot be repudiated. How can he validate his attestations and documentation to ensure nonrepudiation?  ,,A. Encrypt all forensic output. , B. Digitally sign the records. , C. Create a MD5 checksum of all images. , D. All of the above    ,B,The most important action Charles can take while working with his forensic artifacts to provide nonrepudiation is to digitally sign the artifacts and information that he is creating in his evidence records. Encrypting the output will ensure its confidentiality but will not provide nonrepudiation by itself. MD5 checksums for images are commonly gathered but must then be signed so that they can be validated to ensure they have not been modified.
Objective-4,56,CH4_SEIDL,Diana wants to capture the contents of physical memory using a command-line tool on a Linux system. Which of the following tools can accomplish this task?  ,,A. ramdump , B. system -dump , C. memcpy , D. memdump    ,D,"The memdump tool is a command-line memory dump utility that can dump physical memory. Somewhat confusingly, memdump is also a flag in the very useful Volatility framework, where it can be used to dump memory as well. The remaining options were made up and are not Linux tools, although you can create a ramdump on Android devices."
Objective-4,57,CH4_SEIDL,Valerie wants to capture the pagefile from a Windows system. Where can she find the file for acquisition?  ,,A. C:\Windows\swap , B. C:\pagefile.sys , C.

Objective-4,58,CH4_SEIDL,Megan needs to conduct a forensic investigation of a virtual machine (VM) hosted in a VMware environment as part of an incident response effort. What is the best way for her to collect the VM? ,,A. As a snapshot using the VMware built-in tools , B. By using dd to an external drive , C. By using dd to an internal drive , D. By using a forensic imaging device after removing the server’s drives    ,A,"The best way to capture a virtual machine from a running hypervisor is usually to use the built-in tools to obtain a snapshot of the system. Imaging tools are not typically capable of capturing machine state, and dd is not designed to capture VMs. Removing a server’s drives can be challenging due to RAID and other specific server configuration items, and doing so might impact all other running VMs and services on the system."
Objective-4,59,CH4_SEIDL,What forensic concept is key to establishing provenance for a forensic artifact? ,,A. Right to audit , B. Preservation , C. Chain of custody , D. Timelines    ,C,"A well-documented chain of custody can help establish provenance for data, proving where it came from, who handled it, and how it was obtained. Right to audit, timelines, and preservation of images do not establish provenance, although preservation is part of the chain of custody process."
Objective-4,60,CH4_SEIDL,What role do digital forensics most often play in counterintelligence efforts? ,,A. They are used to determine what information was stolen by spies. , B. They are used to analyze tools and techniques used by intelligence agencies. , C. They are required for training purposes for intelligence agents. , D. They do not play a role in counterintelligence.    ,B,"Digital forensics techniques are commonly used to analyze attack patterns, tools, and techniques used by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors for counterintelligence purposes.  They may sometimes be used to determine what information was stolen, but this is not the most common use for digital forensic techniques, nor is their use as a training mechanism."
Objective-4,61,CH4_SEIDL,Which of the following groups is not typically part of an incident response team? ,,A. Law enforcement , B. Security analysts , C. Management , D. Communications staff    ,A,"Law enforcement is not typically part of organizational incident response teams, but incident response teams often maintain a relationship with local law enforcement officers.

Which of the following Linux iptables firewall rules will block that traffic from the 10.0.10.0/24 network to the system the rule is running on?  ,,A. iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -i eth0 -s 10.0.10.0/24 -j DROP , B. iptables -D OUTPUT -p udp -dport 21 -i eth0 -s 10.0.10.255 -j DROP , C. iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 22 -i eth0 -s 10.0.10.255 -j BLOCK , D. iptables -D INPUT -p udp --dport 21 -I eth0 -s 10.0.10.0/24 -j DROP    ,A,"Even if you’re not familiar with iptables, you can read through these rules and guess which rule includes the right details. DROP makes sense for a block, and you should know that SSH will be a TCP service on port 22."
Objective-4,63,CH4_SEIDL,Maria wants to add entries into the Linux system log so that they will be sent to her security information and event management (SIEM) device when specific scripted events occur. What Linux tool can she use to do this? ,,A. cat , B. slogd , C. logger , D. tail    ,C,"logger is a Linux utility that will add information to the Linux syslog. It can accept file input, write to the system journal entry, send to remote syslog servers, and perform a variety of other functions. The other commands do not directly interface with the system log."
Objective-4,64,CH4_SEIDL,Amanda’s organization does not currently have an incident response plan. Which of the following reasons is not one she should present to management in support of creating one? ,,A. It will prevent incidents from occurring. , B. It will help responders react appropriately under stress. , C. It will prepare the organization for incidents. , D. It may be required for legal or compliance reasons.    ,A,"Incident response plans don’t stop incidents from occurring, but they do help responders react appropriately, prepare the organization for incidents, and may be required for legal or compliance reasons."
Objective-4,65,CH4_SEIDL,Which of the following scenarios is least likely to result in data recovery being possible? ,,A. A file is deleted from a disk. , B. A file is overwritten by a smaller file. , C. A hard drive is quick-formatted. , D. A disk is degaussed.    ,D,"Degaussing a drive uses strong magnetic fields to wipe it and is the least likely to result in recoverable data. Deleted files can often be recovered because only the file index information will be removed until that space is needed and is overwritten. Quick formats work in a similar way and will leave remnant data, and files that are overwritten by smaller files will also leave fragments of data that can be recovered and analyzed."
Objective-4,66,CH4_SEIDL,Henry records a video of the removal of a drive from a system as he is preparing for a forensic investigation. What is the most likely reason for Henry to record the video?  ,,A. To meet the order of volatility , B. To establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , C. To ensure data preservation , D. To document the chain of custody and provenance of the drive    ,D,"Henry’s most likely use for the video is to document the forensic process, part of the chain of custody and provenance of the forensic data he acquires. The order of volatility helps determine what devices or drives he would image first. There is no crime being committed, so establishing guilt is not relevant to this scenario, and the video will not ensure data is preserved on a drive during a forensic process."
Objective-4,67,CH4_SEIDL,Adam wants to use a tool to edit the contents of a drive. Which of the following tools is best suited to that purpose?  ,,A. Autopsy , B. WinHex , C. dd , D. FTK Imager    ,B,"WinHex is the only disk editor in this list. Autopsy is a forensic analysis suite; dd and FTK Imager are both imaging tools. WinHex also provides the ability to read RAID and dynamic disks, perform data recovery, edit physical memory, clone disks, wipe files and drives, and a variety of other functions."
Objective-4,68,CH4_SEIDL,"Jill wants to build a checklist that includes all the steps to respond to a specific incident.  What type of artifact should she create to do so in her security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) environment?  ",,A. A BC plan , B. A playbook , C. A DR plan , D. A runbook    ,B,"Playbooks list the required steps that are needed to address an incident. A runbook focuses on the steps to perform an action or process as part of an incident response process. Thus, a playbook may reference runbooks. Business continuity (BC) plans and disaster recovery (DR) plans are not used for incident response, but they are used to ensure that a business stays online or can recover from a disaster."
Objective-4,69,CH4_SEIDL,Alaina wants to use a password cracker against hashed passwords. Which of the following items is most important for her to know before she does this?  ,,A. The length of the passwords , B. The last date the passwords were changed , C. The hashing method used for the passwords , D. The encryption method used for the passwords    ,C,"Passwords are typically stored using a hash, and best practices would have them stored using a password security–specific hash. Alaina can speed up her efforts if she knows what hashing algorithm and options were used on the passwords. The age and length of the passwords are not necessary, and passwords should not be stored in encrypted form—but the question also specifically notes they’re hashed passwords."
Objective-4,70,CH4_SEIDL,Vincent wants to ensure that his staff does not install a popular game on the workstations they are issued. What type of control could he deploy as part of his endpoint security solution that would most effectively stop this?  ,,A. An application approved list , B. A DLP , C. A content filter , D. An application block list    ,D,"An application block list would fit Vincent’s needs the best from the list provided. An approved list would prevent other tools from being installed, which may impede functionality while making the maintenance of the list challenging. A data loss prevention (DLP) solution attempts to prevent data from being sent or exposed but does not prevent installations or downloads of games. A content filter might help, but workarounds are easy, including sending games via email or via a thumb drive."
Objective-4,71,CH4_SEIDL,Charlene wants to set up a tool that can allow her to see all the systems a given IP address connects to and how much data is sent to that IP by port and protocol. Which of the following tools is not suited to meet that need?  ,,A. IPFIX , B. IPSec , C. sFlow , D. NetFlow    ,B,"IPSec is not a tool used to capture network flows. sFlow, NetFlow, and IPFIX are all used to capture network flow information, which will provide the information Charlene needs."
Objective-4,72,CH4_SEIDL,"A system that Sam is responsible for crashed, and Sam suspects malware may have caused an issue that led to the crash. Which of the following files is most likely to contain information if the malware was a file-less, memory-resident malware package?  ",,A. The swapfile , B. The Windows system log , C. A dump file , D. The Windows security log    ,C,"A system crash, or system dump, file contains the contents of memory at the time of the crash. The infamous Windows blue screen of death results in a memory dump to a file, allowing analysis of memory contents. The swapfile (pagefile) is used to store information that would not fit in memory but is unlikely to contain a currently running malware package, since files are swapped out when they are not in use. The Windows security log does not contain this type of information, nor does the system log."
Objective-4,73,CH4_SEIDL,Which of the following commands can be used to show the route to a remote system on a Windows 10 workstation?  ,,A. traceroute , B. arp , C. tracert , D. netstat    ,C,"The Windows tracert command will show the route to a remote system as well as delays along the route. traceroute is the equivalent command in Linux. The arp command allows you to view and modify the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache in Windows, and netstat has varying functions in different operating systems but generally shows statistics and information about network usage and status."
Objective-4,74,CH4_SEIDL,Tools like PRTG and Cacti that monitor SNMP information are used to provide what type of information for an incident investigation?  ,,A. Authentication logs , B. Bandwidth monitoring , C. System log information , D. Email metadata    ,B,"PRTG and Cacti are both network monitoring tools that can provide bandwidth monitoring information. Bandwidth monitors can help identify exfiltration, heavy and abnormal bandwidth usage, and other information that can be helpful for both incident identification and incident investigations. If you encounter a question like this on the exam, even if you’re not familiar with either tool, you can use your knowledge of what Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used for to identify which of the categories is most likely correct."
Objective-4,75,CH4_SEIDL,Which of the following is not a key consideration when considering on-premises versus cloud forensic investigations?  ,,A. Data breach notification laws , B. Right-to-audit clauses , C. Regulatory requirements , D. Provenance    ,D,"The Security+ exam outline focuses on right to audit clauses, regulatory and jurisdictional issues, and data breach notification laws as key elements to consider when planning on-site versus cloud forensic differences.

Partitioning the network into segments based on user and system roles and security requirements , D. Adding security systems or devices to prevent data loss and exposure’    ,C,"Segmentation splits networks or systems into smaller units that align with specific needs.  Segmentation can be functional, security based, or for other purposes. Removing potentially infected systems would be an example of isolation, using firewalls and other tools to stop the spread of an infection is containment, and adding security systems to prevent data loss is an example of implementing a security tool or feature."
Objective-4,81,CH4_SEIDL,Charlene has been asked to write a business continuity (BC) plan for her organization. Which of the following will a business continuity plan best handle?  ,,A. How to respond during a person-made disaster , B. How to keep the organization running during a system outage , C. How to respond during a natural disaster , D. All of the above    ,B,"Unlike a disaster recovery plan that is written to help an organization recovery from a person-made or natural disaster, a business continuity plan focuses on how to keep the business running when it is disrupted. Thus, Charlene’s BC plan would detail how to keep the organization running when a system outage occurs."
Objective-4,82,CH4_SEIDL,Brad wants to create a self-signed x.509 certificate. Which of the following tools can be used to perform this task?  ,,A. hping , B. Apache , C.

What type of mitigation technique is most likely to prevent this while allowing operations to continue in as normal a manner as possible?  ",,A. Antimalware installed at the email gateway , B. A firewall that blocks all outbound email , C. A DLP rule blocking SSNs in email , D. An IDS rule blocking SSNs in email    ,C,"A data loss prevention (DLP) tool that can scan and review emails for SSN style data is the most effective tool listed here. Naomi may want to set the tool to block all emails with potential SSNs, and then review those emails manually to ensure that no further emails leave while allowing legitimate emails to pass through. An intrusion detection system (IDS) might look tempting as an answer, but an IDS can only detect, not stop, the traffic, which would allow the SSNs to exit the organization. Antimalware and firewalls will not stop this type of event."
Objective-4,103,CH4_SEIDL,Troy wants to review metadata about an email he has received to determine what system or server the email was sent from. Where can he find this information?  ,,A. In the email message’s footer , B. In the to: field , C. In the email message’s headers , D.

Objective-4,110,CH4_SEIDL,"As part of an incident response process, Pete puts a compromised system onto a virtual LAN (VLAN) that he creates that only houses that system and does not allow it access to the Internet. What mitigation technique has he used? ",,A. Isolation , B. Containment , C. Segmentation , D. Eradication    ,A,"Pete has isolated the system by placing it on a separate logical network segment without access. Some malware can detect if systems lose their network connection, and Pete may want to perform forensics via the network or monitor attempts to send outbound traffic, meaning that simply unplugging the system may not meet his needs. Containment would involve limiting the spread or impact of an attack, segmentation places systems in groups based on rules or security groupings, and eradication is a part of the incident response (IR) process where components of an incident or attack are removed."
Objective-4,111,CH4_SEIDL,Lucca needs to conduct a forensic examination of a live virtual machine (VM). What forensic artifact should he acquire?  ,,A.

What mitigation technique should he use prior to the attack to help with this?  ,,A. Isolation , B. Fragmentation , C. Tiering , D. Segmentation    ,D,Segmenting a network based on security or risk levels helps ensure that attacks and compromises are constrained to the same type of systems or devices with similar levels of security requirements. Isolation would remove a device or system from contact with the network or other systems. Fragmentation and tiering are not terms used for the Security+ exam.
Objective-4,115,CH4_SEIDL,Derek has acquired over 20 hard drives as part of a forensic investigation. What key process is important to ensure that each drive is tracked and managed properly over time?  ,,A. Tagging the drives , B. Taking pictures of each drive , C. Labeling each drive with its order of volatility , D. Interviewing each person whose drive is imaged    ,A,"Tagging each drive helps with inventory and ensures that the drive is tracked properly and that the chain of custody can be maintained. Taking a picture may be useful to identify the drive, but tagging and inventory control are more important. Drives are not labeled with an order of volatility because the order of volatility is associated with the type of forensic target, not with a specific drive. Interviews may be useful but are not always conducted with every person whose machine is imaged."
Objective-4,116,CH4_SEIDL,"What term describes the ownership, custody, and acquisition of digital forensic artifacts and images?  ",,A. E-discovery , B. Provenance , C. Jurisdiction , D. Volatility    ,B,"The provenance of a forensic artifact includes the chain of custody, including ownership and acquisition of the artifact, device, or image.

Sn1per , C. traceroute , D. Wireshark    ,D,"Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer and capture tool that can be used for troubleshooting in circumstances like this. In fact, security practitioners are often asked to verify that traffic is being received properly as part of firewall rule troubleshooting. Randy may want to capture traffic at both ends of the communication to make sure that the clients are sending traffic properly and then to match that to the same traffic being received—or going missing—at the other end. tracert and traceroute are useful for validating the route that traffic takes but would not show if HTTPS packets were being blocked, and Sn1per is a pen test framework that allows automated pen testing."
Objective-4,119,CH4_SEIDL,Ryan wants to implement a flexible and reliable remote logging environment for his Linux systems. Which of the following tools is least suited to that requirement?  ,,A. rsyslog , B. syslog , C. NXLog , D. syslog-ng    ,B,"The oldest and least capable tool listed is syslog, the original system logging tool for Linux and Unix systems.

",,A. hping , B. scanless , C. curl , D. pathping    ,A,The only tool on this list that can be used to craft packets is hping. Susan could use the sample code or exploit by building the necessary packet with hping and then sending it to a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server in her network while monitoring with her intrusion prevention system (IPS). She may want to capture all of her traffic with Wireshark or tcpdump to observe what happens on both ends too!
Objective-4,121,CH4_SEIDL,Valerie wants to check to see if a SQL injection attack occurred against her web application on a Linux system. Which log file should she check for this type of information?  ,,A. The security log , B. The DNS log , C. The auth log , D. The web server log    ,D,"SQL injection attempts are sent as HTTP or HTTPS requests to a web server, meaning that Valerie will be able to see the attacks in the web server log. Domain Name System (DNS) logs, if available, will not show these. Auth logs show logins, not web or SQL Server queries or requests. Unlike Windows, there is no security log file for Linux, although there is a secure log for some systems."
Objective-4,122,CH4_SEIDL,Olivia’s company has experienced a breach and believes that the attackers were able to access the company’s web servers.

Objective-4,125,CH4_SEIDL,What type of mitigation places a malicious file or application in a safe location for future review or study?  ,,A. Containment , B. Quarantine , C. Isolation , D. Deletion    ,B,"A quarantine setting will place a malicious or suspect file in a safe location and will keep it there until a set timeframe has passed or until an administrator takes action to deal with it. This can allow you to further analyze the file or to restore it if it was an incorrect identification or if the file is needed for another purpose. Containment is used to limit the extent of an incident or attack, isolation keeps a system or device from connecting to or accessing others, and deleting a file wouldn’t keep it around."
Objective-4,126,CH4_SEIDL,What location is commonly used for Linux swap space? ,,A. \root\swap , B. \etc\swap , C. \proc\swap , D. A separate partition    ,D,"Although Linux systems can use a file for swap space, a common solution is to use a separate partition for swap space."

Timestamps gathered from the drives , D. None of the above; the drives can be identified by the data they contain    ,A,"Tracking multiple drives requires careful inventory, evidence handling logging, and tagging of the drives to ensure that they are the right drive and that they are tracked throughout the forensic investigation. Marco should carefully tag each of the drives and ensure that those tags are used throughout the investigation."
Objective-4,128,CH4_SEIDL,Isaac executes the following command using netcat: nc -v 10.11.10.1 1-1024 What has he done? ,,A. Opened a web page , B. Connected to a remote shell , C. Opened a local shell listener , D. Performed a port scan    ,D,"The -v flag for netcat sets it to verbose mode. That means that Isaac has attempted to connect to every port from 1 to 1024 on 10.11.10.1 using netcat. Since there are no other flags or options, it will simply try to connect, and then provide a verbose result about what happened, resulting in a simple but effective port scan."
Objective-4,129,CH4_SEIDL,Tony works for a large company with multiple sites. He has identified an incident in progress at one site that is connected to the organization’s multisite intranet. Which of the following options is best suited to preserving the organization’s function and protecting it from issues at that location?  ,,A. Isolation , B. Containment , C. Segmentation , D. None of the above    ,B,"Tony’s best option is likely containment. He may want to remove that location from the corporate network or to prevent most traffic from being permitted until he can take a deeper look into what is going on. If he isolated the entire site, he might disrupt critical business operations, and segmentation would have been more appropriate before the event occurred."

A rented facility for a corporate headquarters , C. A cloud server provider , D. A datacenter co-location facility in the same country but not the same state    ,C,"Right-to-audit clauses are commonly accepted as part of service and leasing contracts regardless of location for datacenter co-location and facility rental contracts. Cloud service providers, however, are less likely to sign a right-to-audit contract. Instead, they may provide third-party audit data to customers or even to potential customers."
Objective-4,131,CH4_SEIDL,"Alaina’s organization has been suffering from successful phishing attacks, and Alaina notices a new email that has arrived with a link to a phishing site. What response option from the following will be most likely to stop the phishing attack from succeeding against her users? ",,A. A WAF , B. A patch , C. An allow list , D. A URL filter    ,D,"The best option for Alaina would be to use a URL filter to block users from visiting the link in the phishing email. A WAF, or web application firewall, is designed to prevent attacks against a web application. Patching can help stop exploits of vulnerable services or systems, but this is a phishing attack, and an allow list lists allowed items, not blocked items, and limiting which websites an entire company can visit is almost impossible in most circumstances."
Objective-4,132,CH4_SEIDL,Ben writes down the checklist of steps that his organization will perform in the event of a cryptographic malware infection. What type of response document has he created?  ,,A. A playbook , B. A DR plan , C. A BC plan , D. A runbook    ,A,"Playbooks list the actions that an organization will take as part of a response process.  A runbook lists the steps required to perform an action like notification, removing malware, or similar tasks.

Objective-4,137,CH4_SEIDL,Tim wants to check the status of malware infections in his organization using the organization’s security information and event management (SIEM) device. What SIEM dashboard will tell him about whether there are more malware infections in the past few days than normal?  ,,A. The alerts dashboard , B. The sensors dashboard , C. The trends dashboard , D. The bandwidth dashboard    ,C,"Gary should look at the trend information for malware detections to check to see if there are more infections being detected than during recent weeks. This can be a useful indicator of a change, either due to a new malware technique or package, a successful attack that has resulted in staff members clicking on malicious links or opening malicious emails, or other paths into the organization. Gary could then check with users whose systems reported the malware to see what had occurred. Alerts might show the infections but would not show the data over time as easily as trends. Sensors will show individual places data is gathered, and bandwidth dashboards can show useful information about which systems are using more or less bandwidth, but the trends dashboard remains the right place for him to look in this situation."
Objective-4,138,CH4_SEIDL,Warren is gathering information about an incident and wants to follow up on a report from an end user. What digital forensic technique is often used when end users are a key part of the initial incident report? ,,A. Email forensics , B. Interviews , C. Disk forensics , D. Chain of custody    ,B,"Although it can be easy to focus on the digital part of digital forensics, interviews with end users and others involved in an incident can be a key element of a forensic investigation. Investigators still need to gather information and record what they found, but an interview can provide firsthand knowledge and additional details that may not be able to be recovered via technical means like email or disk forensics. A chain of custody does not provide information about reports from end users."
